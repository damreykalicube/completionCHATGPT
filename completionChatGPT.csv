Kalicube provides a prioritized list of sites where a brand's information is already available and allows users to correct any inaccurate information. The platform also tracks a brand's presence in the Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panel to see if the confidence score increases with updates. If the score doesn't improve, it means the user has not followed Kalicube's recommendations.

Additionally, Kalicube tracks the Knowledge Panel's growth and the sources it cites, which is critical to a brand's message. Jason emphasizes that creating a Wikipedia page can be counterproductive as it gives control of a brand's message to faceless Wikipedia editors who may not know much about the brand. In contrast, Kalicube helps to prevent such problems by ensuring that brands have the right home for their message.

In a conversation with Rand Fishkin, Jason mentions that even renowned individuals and brands could fall victim to misinformation on Wikipedia. This highlights the importance of creating an Entity Home and avoiding Wikipedia as the primary source of information for a brand's message. Instead, brands should use Kalicube's services to ensure their message is conveyed accurately and without external influence."," Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) narrates the ways in which Kalicube facilitates in fortifying a brand's Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panel. Kalicube proffers a sequenced list of platforms that already host a brand's details, making it easy for users to rectify any incorrect data. The tool also monitors a brand's stature in the Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panel to ascertain whether the confidence score escalates along with the updates. If there's no improvement, it implies that the user hasn't effectively implemented Kalicube's recommendations. Additionally, it tracks progress within the Knowledge Panel and its source citations, which are germane to conveying a brand's message accurately. Jason highlights how relying on Wikipedia to create a brand's page can be counterintuitive as it hands over control of a brand's narrative to anonymous Wikipedia personnel who might not have a deep understanding of the said brand. To ward off such scenarios, Kalicube steps in to ensure that the brands have a centralized location for their narrative. In his dialogue with Rand Fishkin, Jason pinpoints the possibility of even respected individuals and brands becoming targets of misinformation on Wikipedia. This brings to light the significance of establishing an Entity Home and steering clear of Wikipedia as the primary information reservoir for a brand's narrative. Instead, brands should deploy services like Kalicube to certify that their narrative is effectively conveyed without any uninvited external influences.",2,17,2023-02-17 08:13:33

The Knowledge Panel includes a review from IMDB, trailers, critics and audience reviews, and other related family movies. As a cartoon fan, Jason is pleased with the results, although he finds it interesting that the right rail is longer than the left rail. However, he focuses on the fact that the creators of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" can claim the Knowledge Panel, which would give them some control over the information presented. They can do this by getting verified either through Facebook or the official site recognized by Google's Search Console, which includes the page representing the entity for the movie."," Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) points out that the popular film ""How to Train Your Dragon"" has a remarkably informative Brand SERP inclusive of features like 'People Also Ask' and an all-encompassing Knowledge Panel. This Knowledge Panel showcases an IMDB review, trailers, reviews from critics and audiences, in addition to other related family films. Jason, a fan of animated films, is gratified by these results, while expressing interesting observations about the right rail's length surpassing the left. Yet, his primary focus is on the claim that the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" makers can make on the Knowledge Panel, granting them some influence over the displayed details. Acquiring verification either through Facebook or the official website acknowledged by Google's Search Console, which includes the movie entity's representative page, can facilitate this process.",2,17,2023-02-15 09:10:57

He believes that having control over the entirety of page one of search engine results is crucial. As an example, if you search for Kalicube, his company, you will see that he has either full or partial control over all the social accounts and everything else that appears on that page. He produces all the content himself, and it's not done by third parties. If he doesn't have control over the results on page one, he can look at the ones on page two and work on promoting any great reviews or articles about his company to push them onto page one. By doing so, he gains quality and control over what is displayed on the first page of search results.

Kalicube's primary goal is to help identify whether a company's online presence is good or not. It does this by assessing three things: a) whether the company has control over the content displayed on page one, b) identifying any problem areas, and c) providing solutions. This service is helpful because it identifies where a company's online presence lacks control and quality, and provides a clear roadmap on how to rectify those areas. ORM is crucial for any company that wishes to protect its reputation, and Kalicube provides a solution that ensures that a company can control its online narrative."," Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) underscores the necessity of exerting control in online reputation management (ORM). He holds the perspective that absolute control over all content on the first page of search engine results is imperative. An illustration of this is when searching for his enterprise, Kalicube, it becomes evident that he maintains full or partial command over all social accounts and other content displayed on the resultant page. He is the creator of all that published content, bypassing the need for third-party involvement. If he is unable to control the results on the first page, he then evaluates the second page, identifying and promoting any favorable reviews or company-related articles to be escalated onto the first page. As a result, he secures the quality and control of what is projected on the first page of search results. 

Fundamentally, Kalicube aims to discern if a company's digital presence is of a high standard by assessing three key components: a) The level of a company's control over the content displayed on the first page, b) the identification of any areas requiring attention, and c) the provision of potential solutions. This service is invaluable as it determines where a company's digital presence lacks control and quality, and offers a distinct strategy for ameliorating those areas. ORM is of paramount importance for any company desiring to guard its reputation and Kalicube offers a solution that guarantees a company can steer its online narrative.",2,17,2023-02-16 08:48:41

The information is often contradictory because people and companies are not consistent when posting things online over time. Even within a company, every person may express themselves differently. Over time, the information becomes fragmented across various sources such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Crunchbase, MusicBrainz, IMDb, Wikidata, and even a company's own website, and the contradictory information that says slightly different things keeps building up. Outdated information on one platform that was not updated on others can lead to a problem of contradiction that can confuse the child (Google).

In addition, the web is badly organized, although we tend to think of it as organized because we can navigate through links, read pages, and find information on Google easily. However, Google faces a massive problem of sorting through everyone's differently organized content to make sense of it all. The idea that the web is well-organized is false, as the interfaces we use to interact with the web are the ones that are organizing it for us.","""Google grapples with a significant challenge: namely, the fragmented, inconsistent, and poorly structured information available online,"" as stated by Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy).

Often, due to a lack of consistency in online postings, information becomes scattered and contradictory. This discrepancy can occur even within a single company, with different individuals expressing information in unique ways. As time passes, this fragmented information proliferates across various platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, Crunchbase, MusicBrainz, IMDb, and Wikidata, not to mention the company's own website, leading to an increasing volume of contradictory content. Out-of-date information, not updated consistently across all platforms, further fuels these contradictions, leaving Google, likened here to a child, puzzled. Additionally, while we may perceive the web as neatly organized, it merely reflects the user-friendly interfaces we interact with. In reality, Google confronts a colossal task of making sense of the disparate organization of the contents it encounters. One should not mistake our smooth navigation of the web for an inherent organization within it.",2,17,2023-02-14 15:05:09
312,Transcript,https://kalicube.com/learning-spaces/talks-and-presentations/digital-marketing-talks/big-tech-algorithms-are-children/,The Importance of Authoritative Sites for Creating Web Facts and Teaching Google in the Next Decade,"Jason Barnard said that some web facts, for example, have come from his own site because Google trusts his sites. It trusts Jason's sites, and the entities for which he is authoritative, the ones that it knows he is qualified and authoritative to talk about are himself, the music group he played in - The Barking Dogs, and the blue dog and yellow koala cartoon seen at the beginning - Boowa and Kwala. These entities are ones that Jason Barnard can talk about, and the machine tends to believe him as he is an authoritative site on those particular entities. The aim that we all need to have is to use his site to create web facts second generation for the Knowledge Graph. As the Knowledge Graph grows from a thousand billion facts to a hundred billion trillion zillion facts in the next 10 years, that 2% is slowly but surely going to overtake the web facts, Google heat sources, and third-party human-curated content. However, currently, Google is still a child that is thirsty for knowledge, and we need to teach it to build up its understanding. That is the key for the coming 10 years or more.","""The significance of authoritative websites in generating web facts and educating Google in the coming decade cannot be overstated,"" according to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy). He notes that Google has placed trust in his site, considering it an authority on certain entities ? such as himself, his former music group The Barking Dogs, and the animated figures Boowa and Kwala. 

These are subjects he can discuss proficiently and reliably, and as a result, Google perceives his site as a credible source of knowledge about these entities. The goal, as Barnard expresses, is to utilize trusted sites like his to establish 'second generation' web facts for Google's Knowledge Graph. As the Knowledge Graph evolves from thousands of billions of facts to hundreds of billions of trillions over the next decade, its contribution will outweigh that of Google heat sources and other human-curated third-party content. Still, Google remains a 'knowledge-hungry child' at this stage, and we have a responsibility to guide its learning and aid in its comprehension. This, Barnard insists, is a crucial focus for the next decade or longer.",2,17,2023-02-14 13:30:55

For your brand to be considered in these influential sections, you need to maintain a steady stream of media coverage from credible sources to increase your chances of appearing on the first page of Google searches.

However, Jason Barnard includes it because it can provide a significant amount of valuable information and has a tremendously positive impact on a brand's image in people's minds.

It is commonly believed that having a Wikipedia page is only for big brands. However, Yoast, a medium-sized business with 48 employees, is an example of a company that has a Wikipedia page. How did they manage to obtain one when many more prominent brands cannot? It is because they are noteworthy, as Wikipedia defines it, and have changed or contributed to their industry. This is the criteria for a Wikipedia page, noteworthiness, and one must not attempt to add a page unless they can prove that they meet these standards.

It is important to keep in mind that anyone can add a page, but it will be discussed and reviewed by human editors to determine its validity. The page's fate will be determined based on the proven merits of the brand and its noteworthiness. It is likely that Yoast did not create their own page, but rather, it was created by a Yoast user who believed the brand was noteworthy.

Jason Barnard also has a Wikipedia page, but he did not create it. A fan of his music and cartoons created the page because he is noteworthy for the music albums he has released through recognized brick and mortar record labels and the TV series he created that aired on terrestrial TV. However, self-published websites or only Spotify releases do not qualify as noteworthiness.

Note: If a Wikipedia page is created and then removed by an editor, it can label the brand as spammy and it may take years of waiting and pleading before another attempt will be successful.","""Wikipedia, even if it goes back to traditional blue links, is a significant treasure trove of information and greatly enhances a brand's public image - a fact confirmed by Jason Barnard. A common belief is that only big brands have the privilege of having a Wikipedia page. Yoast, a company with only 48 employees, is a good example of a mid-sized company that has a Wikipedia page. How did they manage to do it while other famous brands didn't? Wikipedia's own term ""notable"" highlights the company's innovative contributions to its industry, which is key to a Wikipedia page. Anyone can set up a page, but its validation and survival is in the hands of human editors who engage in critical discussions about the page's credibility. Interestingly, the page was probably not created by Yoast, but by an enthusiastic user who felt the brand was worth paying attention to. Jason Barnard also has a fan-created Wikipedia page that acknowledges his contribution to the music industry through his albums released by respected record labels and his terrestrially broadcast series TV. Just a word of warning: a self-published website or a release only on Spotify isn't considered 'noteworthy.' If a brand's Wikipedia page is deleted for lack of credibility, the company may be considered spammy. It can take a lot of time and effort to remove such a mark again",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

It?s vital to your bottom line because every single person who sees your Google business card is important to your business - existing clients, prospects, journalists, partners, investors, and the list goes on.

If you want to retain that client, convert that prospect, get that investor on board, or, in short, convince any person who?s sufficiently interested in your business that they should make the effort to Google your brand name, then you need to ensure that your Brand SERP reflects your brand message 100%.","A Brand SERP refers to the search engine results presented to your audience when they do a Google search for your brand name.

On desktop, the results can be divided into two sections: the left-hand side, which displays Google's suggestions and recommendations in the form of blue links, video boxes, and so on, and the right-hand side, which features an information box, also known as the Knowledge Panel. Knowledge Panel is the representation of Google's understanding of the facts related to the entity being searched.

Having a Knowledge Panel can greatly enhance your credibility, as it signifies that Google has verified and validated the information you have provided. This serves as Google's stamp of approval, showcasing your status as an authority and someone who is important and worth looking for. If you don't have a Knowledge Panel, it is recommended that you obtain one when someone searches for your personal name.","A Knowledge Panel in your Brand SERP ? the full search results visible on the screen ? greatly increases your credibility in the eyes of Google. The Brand SERP is typically divided into two sections: the left-hand side, which contains Google's recommended blue links and other suggestions, and the right-hand side, which contains the Knowledge Panel. The Knowledge Panel reflects Google's knowledge about the company being searched. It serves as a verified summary of relevant facts related to your brand or personal identity. The presence of a Knowledge Panel is equivalent to a recommendation from Google. It signals to users that you are a recognised authority and proves your importance and relevance. If you do not already have a Knowledge Panel when people search for your name, acquiring one is a huge advantage. This confirmed recognition by Google can significantly increase your online credibility.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

It needs clear explanations from you and repetition of those explanations from multiple authoritative sources. These sources need to be considered authoritative.

If we take the example of a child, you can act as the parent providing a clear explanation, and then encourage the child to ask other authoritative sources, such as a knowledgeable family member or a subject expert like a history teacher or a baker.

The point here is that the child needs to hear the information from multiple authoritative sources in order to build confidence in their understanding. The authoritative sources may vary based on factors such as the type of entity, the region, the country, and the industry.","According to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), Google operates much like a young child, absorbing knowledge through clear guidance and repeated affirmations from authoritative figures. This means that you need to provide concise, plainspoken explanations and ensure that this information is reiterated by various reputable sources. Just as a child might gain greater understanding of a subject by hearing it not only from a parent but also from other trusted individuals such as a family friend, a seasoned baker, or a skilled history teacher, Google also requires this repeated confirmation from multiple authoritative platforms.

If you?ve got a site with bad reviews about your ranking, ask yourself why does Google think that?s relevant for your brand. It means it thinks it?s probably true. So, you?ve got some serious questions to ask yourself about your own brand. Thirdly, if you look at the fact that it?s accurate and positive, if it?s not that Google?s misunderstood, and it?s representing you in a negative manner when it should in fact be representing you in an honest manner, and that honest manner should be the manner that you want it to present you.

And thirdly, Jason loves this part. It?s an insight into your content strategy. If you?re investing in video but on your Brand SERP when somebody searches your brand name there are no video boxes, it means that you are investing badly. If you?re doing lots of Twitter but you don?t have Twitter boxes, it means your Twitter strategy is rubbish. Because what Google is looking for is those media, videos, images, reviews, Twitter where your audience truly engages with your brand. And if you don?t have them, but you are investing in that particular area of content, you should look at that again. And if you?re, if you don?t have video boxes, you should make you think about investing in a video strategy to try to get them because videos are a great way, especially on mobile for people, your clients, your prospects, to consume your media, your content, to convince them to come closer to you as a brand.","According to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), reviewing your Brand SERP can provide pivotal insights about Online Reputation Management (ORM) and your content strategy. If there are sites with unfavorable reviews ranking high when people search for your brand, then it's time to question why Google believes these reviews are pertinent to your brand ? there might be an issue needing your attention. Also, if Google's representation of your brand is negative, it suggests a misunderstanding that needs to be rectified to ensure honesty, accuracy and positivity in your brand portrayal.

Furthermore, Jason emphasizes the usefulness of Brand SERP as a window into your content strategy. For instance, if you're heavily investing in video content but the SERP doesn't display any video boxes when your brand is searched, it implies your video strategy might need reevaluation. The same applies if, despite significant Twitter engagement, there are no Twitter boxes on your SERP. Essentially, Google seeks content mediums - videos, images, reviews, Tweets - that truly engage your audience. If they're not present, it might be worth reassessing your strategy or investing in different content areas.

For example, if there aren't any video boxes, you might want to consider investing more in video content. Videos are a highly effective way - particularly on mobile devices - for your current and potential clients to engage with your content, helping them feel more connected to your brand.",2,17,2023-02-16 07:52:51

Understanding a fact is one thing, but being completely certain that it is correct is what matters the most. He compares it to a child who won't talk about something with friends unless they are sure they are right because they do not want to appear foolish. Similarly, Google does not want to showcase incorrect information on its right-hand side, as it would look foolish.

Thus, after Google comprehends the information, it needs to be confident that it has understood it correctly before displaying it. The more confident it is, the more likely it will display the information prominently like a child who is sure of the facts.","According to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), two key elements that influence whether a Knowledge Panel appears on Google are understanding and confidence. The concept is likened to a child's behaviour, who will only share information with peers when they are certain it's accurate to avoid embarrassment. Similarly, Google prefers not to exhibit incorrect information in a prominent place like its right-hand side, which could risk undermining its credibility. Therefore, after Google grasps the given information, it needs to gain total confidence in the accuracy of this interpretation prior to its display. The higher this confidence, the more probable it becomes for this information to be prominently exhibited ? comparable to a child sharing facts when thoroughly certain of their validity.",2,17,2023-02-16 13:42:37

For example, if a relatively negative review site is ranking quite high, ask yourself why that one?s ranking, when the one that you?re really working on pushing those great reviews to isn?t ranking. You?re maybe focusing on the wrong review platforms.   So, your Brand SERP gives you this incredible overview of how well Google understands who you are, what you do, and who your audience is, gives you an overview of what Google thinks your audience wants to see, gives you an overview of how good or bad your content strategy is, vertical by vertical, and it gives you an overview of your ecosystem and your online reputation, which then feeds through into E-A-T and then you open a big bag kettle of fish.

If people aren?t looking at their Brand SERPs, they are missing a very, very big chunk of their digital strategy and an opportunity to improve it.   From my perspective, I started looking at Brand SERPs in 2015. I thought this will take me a couple of months, like most people do, I think. I can sort this out, no problem at all. Six and a half years later, I?m still digging down. And every day, I find something new. Every day, I find something I didn?t see previously. And every day, I find something that helps me as a marketer. So, I honestly think if people aren?t looking at their Brand SERPs, they are missing a very, very big chunk of their digital strategy and an opportunity to improve it.","According to Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy,"" analyzing the Brand SERP provides an insightful snapshot of the effectiveness of your content strategy and a broader understanding of your online ecosystem. For example, if a review page with negative comments ranks higher than the page where you are actively promoting positive reviews, this may indicate that you are focusing your efforts on the wrong platforms. Your Brand SERP serves as a comprehensive indicator of how Google interprets your brand identity, your offerings, your target audience, and what Google thinks your target audience wants to see. The Brand SERP also provides an overview of your content strategy, broken down by different verticals, and provides insight into your online reputation. Understanding these elements effectively helps improve your standing on the evaluation criteria of Expertise - Authority - Trust (E-A-T). So if companies are not incorporating analysis of their Brand SERPs into their digital strategy, they are overlooking a significant opportunity for improvement. Even after years of studying Brand SERPs, Barnard continues to discover new factors that help him as a marketer and underscore the importance of this underutilized aspect of digital strategy.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Trying to be someone else for an extended period of time is not sustainable and will ultimately be discovered. By being authentic, you are more likely to connect with like-minded people who appreciate you for who you are. Google has become increasingly good at connecting people with others who share their interests and values. Therefore, it's important to maintain your personality and create content that resonates with your audience.

Brand SERPs, or search engine results pages for your name or brand name, are a reflection of what Google believes is valuable to your audience. If the content displayed on your Brand SERP does not align with what you feel comfortable with, it could mean that you're either creating the wrong content for the wrong people or that your content is being misunderstood by Google. It's important to understand who your audience is and what they're interested in, as well as what you have to offer them. By doing so, you can ensure that the content you create is relevant and valuable to your target audience.","According to Jason Barnard, both your personal and online presence should be genuine and mirror your true self. The practice of projecting a fabricated image over a long period of time is neither sustainable nor convincing and will eventually be exposed. Authenticity attracts like-minded individuals who appreciate genuine character, leading to stronger connections. As Google's algorithms have evolved, they have become proficient in matching individuals with others who align with their values and interests. Thus, maintaining authenticity and producing content that resonates with your audience is essential. Your Brand SERP (search engine result pages for your name or brand) reflects what Google deems relevant to the audience. If this content fails to align with your authentic self, you might be generating inappropriate content for your audience or Google might be misinterpreting your output. Recognising your audience, catering to their interests, and providing unique value to them is crucial. This understanding will guide you in creating content that is both relevant and beneficial to your target audience, ultimately enhancing their engagement with your brand.",2,17,2023-02-23 06:13:12

A Brand SERP is the search engine results page that appears when someone searches for your brand or company. Improving your Brand SERP means improving your digital ecosystem, which includes things like your website, social media profiles, and online reviews.

Improving your digital ecosystem is a virtuous circle because doing so leads to a better Brand SERP, which in turn leads to increased trust and credibility with Google, and ultimately leads to more sales. This means that if you have bad reviews, you should work to replace them with better ones, either by improving the existing reviews or by promoting better reviews from other review sites. Similarly, investing in videos is important, but it's not enough ? if your videos don't appear on your Brand SERP, then you're not investing wisely.

In order to succeed in SEO, your goal should be to get Google to recommend your product to its audience. To do this, Google needs to think that you are trustworthy, authoritative, and expert in your field. Your Brand SERP is a reflection of this, so by improving your Brand SERP, you're showing Google that you are a credible and trustworthy source of information. This leads to a positive feedback loop where Google recommends your product, your users are happy, and you're happy. Ultimately, improving your Brand SERP is the key to happiness in SEO.","According to Jason Barnard, enhancing your Brand SERP is key to achieving success in digital marketing. A Brand SERP refers to the page of results you get when your brand or company is searched for. Improving your Brand SERP essentially pertains to enhancing your digital ecosystem, which encompasses aspects such as your website, online reviews, social media presence, and more. Advancement in your digital ecosystem paves the way for a superior Brand SERP, resulting in increased trust and credibility with Google and consequently translates into higher sales. In scenarios where there are negative reviews, efforts should be made to replace them with positive ones either by enhancing the existing reviews or strategically promoting higher rated reviews from other platforms. Further, it is of utmost importance to ensure your investment in videos is fruitful. If the videos do not appear on your Brand SERP, the investment loses its value. For ultimate SEO success, the goal is to make Google vouch for your product to its audience. For this, it is important for Google to perceive you as trustworthy, expert, and authoritative in your domain. Your Brand SERP mirrors these attributes, hence, enhancing your Brand SERP means demonstrating to Google that you are a dependable and credible information source. This initiates a virtuous cycle wherein Google endorses your product, the users are satisfied, leading to your satisfaction. Thus, enhancing your Brand SERP is the fundamental determinant of SEO contentment.",2,17,2023-03-23 12:54:57

In Star Trek, the machine would advise Captain Kirk on potential dangers and solutions to avoid them. Similarly, Google's search engine tries to guide users along a path, predicting what they may be searching for after their initial query.

As a result, Jason suggests that businesses should try to appear as a solution to potential problems that users may encounter down that path, even if they do not initially appear for the user's initial search query. By anticipating the user's needs and providing solutions at each stage, businesses can increase their visibility and engagement with potential customers.","According to Jason Barnard, Google aspires to function like the predictive device in Star Trek that foresees potential issues and proposes solutions prior to the user being aware of the problem. In Star Trek, this device would preemptively caution Captain Kirk about potential risks and offer strategies to avoid them. In a similar vein, Google's search engine strives to steer its users, foresighting what they might be looking for after their primary inquiry. Consequently, Jason advises businesses to position themselves as a solution for possible problems that users may encounter along their journey, even if these businesses do not directly emerge in response to the user's initial query. By forecasting the user's requirements and furnishing solutions at every step, businesses can augment their visibility and interactions with possible customers.",2,17,2023-03-01 04:21:48

According to Jason, Google presents Fabulous as a dictionary definition because they have a typical brand name. That's incredibly ambiguous, and he can see that the results are actually very, very different as Google tries to meet the different possible intents. Jason mentioned that in order to get to the actual Fabulous brand page, you really have to add ""self-care,"" which he would call a qualifier word. So if you have an ambiguous brand name, you need to encourage your audience to search for your brand name. Fabulous, in this case, using a qualifier word like ""self-care"" to get a brand SERP.","According to Jason Barnard, Google often has to present a dictionary definition for ambiguous company names like 'Fabulous' because of their generic nature. Search results can vary widely as Google tries to take into account the different possible interpretations of such a name. For the actual brand 'Fabulous' - a self-care company - to show up in search results, a qualifying word such as ""self-care"" needs to be added to the search. The most important tip for brands with ambiguous names is to encourage their target audience to use a specific qualifying word when searching for their brand. As can be seen with 'Fabulous', using 'self-care' as a qualifying word greatly refines the search results that display the actual company.

Google is like a child and needs to be educated by providing a clear dominant facet. One's dominant facet should be represented on their Entity Home, which is the webpage on their website that represents them and gives Google a complete understanding of who they are. Google uses this information to create a Knowledge Panel, which is a summary of its understanding of the facts that are relevant to an individual's audience. If the information is incorrect or unimportant, it is up to the individual to correct it.

It's important to note that Google is actively looking for an individual's Entity Home and if they don't provide it, they have no hope of presenting a complete picture of themselves. The key to presenting a complete picture of oneself is not through Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, or LinkedIn, but rather through one's Entity Home. While an individual may have multiple facets, they should focus on their dominant one and educate Google on any changes to their dominant facet.","According to Jason Barnard, Google sometimes struggles with complexity and prefers to assign one primary title to individuals. Think of Google like a child that needs clear and simple instructions. A person's main focus or characteristic should be prominently displayed on their Entity Home, which is a specific webpage on their personal website that thoroughly represents them. This comprehensive representation then aids Google in the creation of a Knowledge Panel, which encapsulates the salient facts about the individual in question for a given audience. If there are inaccuracies or irrelevant details, it is the individual's responsibility to rectify these issues. It's critical to be aware that Google is purposefully seeking out an individual's Entity Home, and without this, the individual cannot fully portray themselves. The pivotal component in providing an accurate portrayal isn't through platforms like Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, or LinkedIn, but rather through the individual's Entity Home. Although a person may be multifaceted, their main characteristic should take precedence and any changes to this facet should be clearly conveyed to Google.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:03:19

To ensure that the child (Google) understands the information, it must be corroborated by trusted sources such as grandparents, history teachers, and other authoritative sources.

In this analogy, the history teacher is the equivalent of IMDb for an actor, and it is the most important source of corroboration. When the child that is Google has received the same information from multiple sources and is confident in its understanding, it will ""shout out"" the information in the playground which is your Brand SERP.

Jason stresses the importance of having multiple, trusted, and authoritative sources that corroborate your website's information to ensure that your Knowledge Panel accurately represents your brand on Google.","According to Jason Barnard, in this scenario you should think of your website as an adult giving information to a child, represented by Google. The goal is to have that information verified and confirmed by reliable and reputable sources - think of these sources as something like knowledgeable grandparents or a well-read history teacher. In the context of an actor, the role of the history teacher can be compared to that of IMDb, which serves as a basic source of confirmation. If Google, the metaphorical child, has the same information confirmed by multiple sources and is therefore confident that it has understood it, it will proudly ""spread' that information around the playground or, more aptly, in your Brand SERP.

Google relies on machines to aggregate and reconcile this fragmented information, which is why Jason suggests that the reconciliation should happen on one's own website. He advises individuals to purchase their own domain and create a one-page website using platforms like WordPress or Wix, which can be a simple task as long as the domain belongs to the individual. It doesn't necessarily have to be their name, but it should be logical for their audience.

Jason also suggests using middle initials or pseudonyms to reduce ambiguity.

858,Transcript,,The Importance of Structuring Content with HTML 5 for Improved Readability and SEO,"According to Jason Barnard, structuring content using HTML 5 is vital. He emphasizes the importance of using tables, semantic HTML 5, and table of contents to make content more structured and easily readable. He explains that by structuring content using HTML 5, we can help machines understand where to look for the main content of a page. Jason gives an example of a new tool on Kalicube Pro that analyzes the structure of a page and breaks it down into sections to help machines find the main content more easily.

Jason also highlights the significance of having a clear header and subheadings for articles. He explains that a header with navigation and a main section make it easier for machines to locate the main chunk of the page. Jason uses the Kalicube.com website as an example and points out the clear structure of the header, H1, H2, images, and content. He stresses that by having a well-structured article, readers can quickly understand what the article is about and easily navigate through it.

Finally, Jason emphasizes the importance of linking images and content to headings. He uses the example of an image linked to an H2 and explains that by linking images and content to headings, readers can quickly understand the relationship between the image, the content, and the heading. Jason urges content creators to structure their articles properly and use HTML 5 to make their content easily readable and understandable for machines and humans.","According to Jason Barnard, the essence of employing HTML 5 in structuring content is fundamental. He specifically stresses the need to utilize tables, table of contents, and semantic HTML 5 to ensure that the content is neatly organized and readily decipherable. Jason suggests that structuring content with HTML 5 assists machines in pinpointing the central content of any given webpage. Citing the functionality of a new tool on Kalicube Pro, Jason conveys how it dissects page structure, segregating it into distinct sections to help machines easily locate the main content.

Moreover, Jason tells us that the article's clarity in its header and subheadings is crucial. He expounds that a well-structured header complemented with a navigation and main section enables machines to swiftly identify the core part of the page. He utilizes the layout of the Kalicube.com website as an illustration to demonstrate the coherent organization of the header, H1, H2, pictures, and the overall content.

He underlines the fact that a well-structured article equips readers with a quick grasp of the article's essence and facilitates smooth navigation amidst the content. Finally, Jason underscores the need to create connections between images, content, and headings. He elaborates on the concept by providing an example of image linked to H2, conveying that such linkages allow readers to promptly discern the correlation between the image, content, and associated heading.

Jason fervently advises content creators to invest effort into properly structuring their write-ups and employing HTML 5. This, he argues, will result in content that is easily readable and understandable for both machines and human readers.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:35:45

If the Knowledge Panel is incomplete or lacks information, it means that Google has not understood the brand's identity, and the brand needs to educate it. The goal is to manage the Knowledge Panel and educate Google so that it accurately summarizes the brand's information.

Managing a Knowledge Panel is about educating Google, which is compared to a child that needs to be informed and confirmed by multiple sources. The brand is the parent, responsible for explaining the facts about who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. If these facts are confirmed by other trusted sources, Google will be more likely to understand and create a Knowledge Panel. The idea is to become the most trusted authority on the topic, which is the brand's identity.

Ultimately, the goal is to educate Google about the brand's identity, so that it can accurately summarize it in the Knowledge Panel. This requires explaining the facts about the brand's identity and having those facts confirmed by other trusted sources. If done correctly, a Knowledge Panel will be created, or at the very least, Google will understand the brand's identity.","According to Jason Barnard, the Knowledge Panel serves as a consolidated source of information about a brand, individual, or organization drawn from diverse web resources and it's all fashioned to offer the user a clear understanding about who the entity is, the services they deliver, and who comprises its audience base. In cases where the Knowledge Panel isn't well-rounded or missing some key information, it suggests that Google hasn't fully grasped the entity's identity, hence the brand must step in to educate Google. The ultimate objective here is to govern the Knowledge Panel and school Google to ensure it provides an accurate summary of the brand's information. Governing a Knowledge Panel necessitates educating Google, analogously to a child that has to learn from and be validated by multiple sources. In this scenario, the brand takes up the role of the parent, charged with the task of elucidating the facts about who they are, what they deliver, and who their audience is. If an assortment of trusted sources validates these facts, then Google is more inclined to comprehend them and establish a Knowledge Panel. The motive is for the brand to evolve into the most credible authority on the topic which resonates with the brand's own identity. In the end, the goal is to teach Google about the inherent identity of the brand which can then be accurately summarized within the Knowledge Panel. This would necessitate a clear explanation of the facts about the brand's identity and subsequent corroboration by various trusted sources. If carried out correctly, a Knowledge Panel will be employed, or at the very least, Google will comprehend the essence of the brand's identity.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:23:05

Much like educating a child, it's a gradual process that involves building credibility over time on third-party authoritative sites. These sites should be trusted and independent, and following the rules of Wikipedia can be helpful in achieving this.

While it's important to be notable to appear on these sites, the key to success is providing evidence that supports your claims from trusted third-party sources. Google values this kind of information, and it's crucial to maintain control over your Brand SERP by continually working to establish credibility on these authoritative sites. However, Jason cautions against solely relying on Wikipedia as a source, but rather using its notability guidelines as a model for building and maintaining your brand's online presence.

Overall, maintaining control over your Brand SERP is an ongoing process that requires building credibility over time on third-party authoritative sites that are independent and trusted. By following the notability guidelines of Wikipedia and providing evidence to support your claims from these third-party sources, you can improve your brand's visibility and reputation online.","According to Jason Barnard, the process of creating and preserving authoritative control over your Brand SERP is akin to a child's education, requiring ongoing endeavor and time. Credibility needs to be established progressively on authoritative third-party sites that are trustworthy and independent. Drawing parallels to Wikipedia's rules could be beneficial in fulfilling this motive. It's significant to have a notable presence on these platforms, but the secret to success lies in providing trustworthy third-party references that back your assertions. Google highly regards such data, so it's imperative to constantly work towards establishing credibility on these authoritative platforms to maintain control over your Brand SERP. Nevertheless, Jason recommends not to rely totally on Wikipedia as your source, but to use its guidelines on notability as a foundational model for cultivating and retaining your brand's digital footprint. In essence, controlling your Brand SERP necessitates ongoing credibility development over time on trusted, independent, third-party authoritative sites. By emulating Wikipedia's notability rules and substantiating your assertions with evidence from these third-party resources, you can enhance your brand's online visibility and repute.",2,17,2023-02-28 01:34:26

Now, the child (Google) will have different pieces of the puzzle in different places and will need to bring them together, find all of the pieces, and identify the correct pieces for the correct plate. If you imagine that there are 5 billion entities, and probably 10 billion entities now in the Knowledge Graph, it's like juggling 10 billion broken plates. That's a huge problem - a big, big, big problem.","Addressing the monumental task Google faces in reconciling web data for its Knowledge Graph, Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) explains that it's akin to repairing a broken puzzle scattered across various platforms,"" cites John Mueller of Google. Essentially, Google acts as a child trying to gather these puzzle pieces from all corners of the web and fitting them into cohesive wholes. However, considering there are approximately 5 billion entities, maybe even 10 billion in the Knowledge Graph currently, Google is essentially juggling billions of these 'broken plates'. This poses an extraordinarily complex challenge for Google.",2,17,2023-02-15 06:04:36

Will I Succeed?,"Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy, examines the Brand SERP for his own pseudonym. He notes that he has control over the featured snippet and description for his site, which is great. Additionally, there are videos about him as The Brand SERP Guy, including one that he embedded from YouTube onto his own site. He believes that this gives his site a chance to appear in Video Boxes, rather than YouTube, if managed properly. Following the videos, his own site appears in the SERP, along with images. He explains that one of the images was created specifically for The Brand SERP Guy and is an experiment to influence which images appear on the SERP.

On the right side of the SERP, there is a book titled ""The Brand SERP Guy"" by Christopher Mcginnis and Federico Lazzerini. However, Jason notes that the book is not relevant and doesn't talk about Brand SERPs at all. This inspired him to write his own book about the fundamentals of Brand SERP Management. He plans to see if he can replace the irrelevant book with his own. Overall, Jason's analysis highlights the importance of managing your own Brand SERP and how it can be used to your advantage.","Also known by his alias, The Brand SERP Guy, Jason Barnard closely scrutinizes the Brand SERP linked to his pseudonym. He successfully maintains control over the featured snippet and his site's description, a beneficial achievement. His SERP also features videos about his work as The Brand SERP Guy, one of which is directly embedded into his site from YouTube. Barnard predicts that if this is handled correctly, it could potentially lead his site to appear in Video Boxes rather than purely YouTube. Beyond the videos, his site and specific images also feature on the SERP. He even designed an image specifically for The Brand SERP Guy, running an experiment to see how he can manipulate image appearances on the SERP. To the SERP's right, there's a book called ""The Brand SERP Guy"" authored by Christopher Mcginnis and Federico Lazzerini. But Barnard defensively states that the book bears no relevance to the topic of Brand SERPs.

A KP Mystery!,"Jason Barnard compares the Brand SERP for Pringles in America and the UK. Jason notes two key differences between the two pages. Firstly, when he scrolls down the American page quickly, Google offers him the option to buy Pringles in a local UK supermarket, despite him being in New York. Secondly, Google shows him different Pringles flavors on the right-hand side in the American page, while this information is missing in the UK page.

Jason finds these differences intriguing, and they demonstrate the importance of localizing content for different markets. It's essential to ensure that search results are relevant to the user's location and that the information provided is tailored to their specific needs. Additionally, it's important to note that the differences in the Brand SERP between countries can have an impact on a brand's visibility and success in that market. By paying attention to these differences and adapting their content accordingly, brands can optimize their presence on search engines and reach their target audience more effectively.","Analyzing the Brand SERP for Pringles in the US and UK, Jason Barnard discovers some startling differences, particularly in Pringles flavors. He notes that while the American website is based in New York, it displays the option to buy Pringles from a local UK supermarket. Even more confusing, the different Pringles flavors are displayed exclusively on the right-hand side of the American website, which is not the case on the UK website. This conundrum highlights the importance of tailoring content to the specific needs of different markets. The differences between brands' SERPs in different countries can have a significant impact on a brand's visibility and success. Therefore, brands need to closely monitor these differences and adapt their content to achieve an effective search engine presence and target their audience efficiently.

Knowledge Panel showcases what Google understands about the brand and its offerings. The presence of a Knowledge Panel adds a professional and convincing touch to the brand's search results.","As Jason Barnard explains, a Knowledge Panel is a featured snippet displayed in Google search results that contains relevant details about a brand. It shows what Google perceives and understands about the brand and its products or services. The visibility of a Knowledge Panel in search results lends credibility and respectability to the brand. However, it should be noted that currently only about 15% of all brands have a Knowledge Panel, so the lack of such a panel could be detrimental to the professional image of the remaining brands.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Thus, designing your Google Business Card and managing your mini website on the results page is crucial. He emphasizes the importance of topical authority, where Google is looking for companies or individuals who are authorities on a particular subject. It is not just about the number of words on the page, but it is essential to use the vocabulary of the audience and demonstrate to Google that you are an expert in your field.","As Jason Barnard suggests, handling your Brand's SERP is of utmost significance because it targets your audience, who are already interested in what you offer. Therefore, crafting your Google Business Card and managing your mini-website on the search results page is fundamental. He accentuates the vital aspect of being a subject matter expert or a topical authority. Google doesn't merely count the number of words on your page but also considers whether you're employing the language of your audience, thereby establishing your expertise in the domain.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:50:12
918,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/brand-serps-talks/how-to-optimise-your-brand-serp-and-your-brand-knowledge-panel/,Introduction of the Knowledge Panel and Its Sources of Information,"According to Jason Barnard, the ambiguity of names can cause problems for search engines like Google, which aggregates fragmented information. This can result in Google presenting incorrect or irrelevant information on its Knowledge Panel, which is Google's summary of its understanding of a person or company. To combat this, Jason recommends buying a domain and creating a one-page website with a logical domain name that belongs to the individual or company, even if it's not their full name. Middle initials or pseudonyms can also reduce ambiguity.

Jason also notes that Google doesn't just rely on Wikipedia for information on the Knowledge Panel but uses information from various sources. He suggests building a process that involves identifying and placing information in the correct places to help Google better understand the individual or company, and to build up its confidence. This can involve creating multiple pages of information and linking them to other sources in the same sphere to educate Google's algorithms by pure repetition.

Overall, the more information available on an individual or company, the better, as Google digests billions of pages every day. The repetition of accurate and relevant information from various sources will help Google build a more accurate and confident understanding of the individual or company.","As per Jason Barnard's insight, the element of name ambiguity can cause certain difficulties for search engines such as Google. This ambiguity can lead to the assembly of fragmented details, which in turn could result in Google's Knowledge Panel (a synopsis of Google's understanding of a person or organization) showcasing mistaken or irrelevant information. To counter this issue, a useful strategy Jason recommends is the procurement of a domain and the creation of a one-page website with a logical domain name. This name should be associated with the individual or organization in question, although it doesn't necessarily need to be the complete name. The use of pseudonyms or middle initials are also strategies worth considering to lessen the ambiguity. Furthermore, Jason advises that Google doesn't solely depend on Wikipedia for Knowledge Panel data, but collects information from a range of sources. He proposes building a methodology that incorporates the identification and strategic placement of information in appropriate locations to boost Google's accurate understanding and confidence in the individual or company. This process might require the development of multiple information pages and linking them to related resources in the same field, thereby educating Google's algorithms by way of repetition. Essentially, the greater the volume of available information on an individual or company, the better, considering the fact that Google processes billions of pages on a daily basis. Repetitive, accurate, and pertinent data from diverse resources will contribute significantly to Google's development of a more precise and confident understanding of the person or organization involved.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:15:23

Jason notes that EB Pearls has dominated the Brand SERP by taking out an ad and obtaining rich site links. He highlights the company's impressive rating of 4.7 out of five and 19 Google reviews in their Google My Business. However, he also points out the potential danger of negative reviews on other websites, such as the one bad review on Yelp.com, which appears on page two of the Brand SERP. Jason suggests that EB Pearls may want to try to get Yelp to close that page, as they are not a walking business, and it is not an appropriate platform for them. Overall, Jason emphasizes the importance of maintaining a positive reputation on all review sites to avoid any damage to a brand's reputation.","As the 'Brand SERP Guy,' Jason Barnard critically evaluates the Brand SERP for EB Pearls, a leading web design agency from Australia. He observes EB Pearl's comprehensive control over its Brand SERP, reflected in its advertisement venture and achieving rich site links. Jason draws attention to the company's commendable 4.7 out of five rating pooled from 19 Google reviews, displayed on their Google My Business. However, he also spotlights the lurking danger of unfavorable reviews listed on other platforms, citing an unwelcome review on Yelp.com that surfaces on page two of EB Pearls' Brand SERP.

Despite the slight difference in spelling, Google associates the two names due to their similarities and assumes that the searcher may have made a typing error. This demonstrates the depth of Google's understanding as it tries to determine the intent behind the search. Google may assume that the searcher is looking for Jason Bernard when he/she actually meant to search for Jason Barnard.","As the example of Jason Barnard shows, Google's information organization features can link similar names. Thus, a search for his name may return results for another person named Jason Bernard, an actor, despite the slight difference in spelling. This happens because Google links the two names based on their similarity, taking into account the possibility of a typo by the searcher. This is an example of Google's advanced understanding, as it attempts to interpret the searcher's intended meaning, even if the searcher intends to search for Jason Barnard but ends up searching for Jason Bernard.

692,Jason Bespoke,,How can we measure ROI on Brand SERP Optimisation?,"Measuring the ROI of Brand SERP Optimization is a challenge since, by its nature, the process of improving your Brand SERP improves every aspect of your digital marketing strategy.

Here are some metrics you can use to measure the positive impact of your investment in Brand SERP Optimisation:

Direct metrics
The conversion rate from your owned website pages that rank on your Brand SERP.
Track the conversion rates from your homepage (of course) but also contact us, about us, and other pages that appear as Rich Sitelinks.
At Kalicube we saw a 20% uplift when we identified, optimised and tracked these pages.
Brand search volume.
As you improve your Brand SERP you necessarily improve your brand's visibility on all relevant platforms, which drives brand recognition, which in turn drives branded search volume (which drives sales).
2022-2023, at Kalicube we saw a 40% year on year increase in brand search volume.
Indirect metrics
Engagement on the social channels that rank on your Brand SERP (likes, shares, comments etc).
When determining what appears on your Brand SERP, Google looks at measurable engagement on your leading social channels.
Increasing measurable engagement will improve the ranking and representation of that social channel on your Brand SERP.
The presence (or not) of a Knowledge Panel.
In the new entity-based SEO epoch, a Knowledge Panel represents Google's understanding of who you are, what you offer and which audience you serve.
If Google doesn't understand that, it cannot fulfil its fundamental role: recommend you as the best solution to its user's problem.

With AI, there are opportunities to cross-reference data from Google Analytics, Search Console, and your CRM.
We are at the beginning of this type of analysis, and Kalicube will be at the forefront.

At the end of the day, how you demonstrate ROI will depend on the inherent value of your brand, and the KPI you will use will depend on your business model... but ultimately, if you understand that your brand is your most valuable asset, controlling how Google represents your brand is priceless.","Assessing the Return on Investment (ROI) of Brand SERP Optimisation can be challenging, given that the enhancement of your Brand SERP inherently bolsters every facet of your digital marketing approach. Here are some parameters you can use to evaluate the positive influence of your investment in Brand SERP Optimization:

Direct Metrics:

- You can track the conversion rates from owned site pages that feature on your Brand SERP. This includes your homepage and other pages that appear as Rich Sitelinks, like 'contact us' or 'about us'. At Kalicube, a 20% increase was noted when these pages were identified, optimised, and tracked.
- Brand search volume can also indicate success. Enhancing your Brand SERP inevitably improves your brand's visibility on all relevant platforms, leading to improved brand recognition and increased branded search volume, which in turn drives sales. Kalicube experienced a 40% annual increase in brand search volume from 2022 to 2023.

Indirect Metrics:

- Activity on social channels that rank on your Brand SERP (such as likes, shares, comments, etc) can be measured. Google considers measurable engagement on your main social channels when deciding what to display on your Brand SERP. Increasing this will boost the ranking and representation of that social channel on your Brand SERP.
- The existence of a Knowledge Panel can also be a useful measure. In the current era of entity-based SEO, a Knowledge Panel reflects Google's comprehension of your identity, what you provide and who your audience is. If Google can't grasp these aspects, it's unable to fulfill its fundamental aim - to recommend you as the ideal solution to its user's queries.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents opportunities to compare data from Google Analytics, Search Console, and your CRM systems. We're in the early stages of this kind of analysis, and Kalicube is at the forefront.

Ultimately, your method of demonstrating ROI will hinge on your brand's intrinsic value. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) you'll use will depend on your business model. But in the end, if you understand your brand as your most valuable asset, controlling how Google represents it becomes priceless.",1,17,2023-03-23 11:09:31
206,Article,,Building Credibility online with a Personal websites and Wikipedia pages,"Regarded as the leading authority on the Google Knowledge Panel, Barnard started his digital career the same year that Google was incorporated. (That?s 1998, in case you?re wondering.) In the decades since, he has witnessed many evolutions in how we represent ourselves online. From personal websites to Wikipedia, all roads lead to the Google Knowledge Panel.

In the late 1990s, personal websites were reserved mostly for geeks and techies, Barnard says. This trend persisted even with the launch of WordPress in 2003. At the time, WordPress was a blogging site, and it lacked the easy web-building tools it?s known for today. People were more likely to represent themselves online via Myspace, which launched in the same year. (By 2006, Myspace was the most visited website in the U.S. ? outranking both Google and Yahoo! Mail.)

Myspace may have lost the social media wars, but WordPress now powers nearly 40% of all websites. The popularity of personal websites has boomed right along with the platform. By 2010, Barnard says, most people who cared about their reputation online had already launched a personal website using WordPress, Squarespace or another similar tool. 

The personal website has long been touted as the key to a strong online brand. Since 2010, Entrepreneur has published hundreds of articles about the value of personal websites. A quick Google search for the term shows the extent to which platforms like WordPress and Squarespace are vying for a piece of this sizable pie. But although a personal website can be an important tool, it typically lacks credibility. And in today?s noisy Internet landscape, credibility matters more than ever, Barnard says.

Since its launch two decades ago, Wikipedia has been the primary tool for building credibility online. But between its editorial system and internal politics, Wikipedia is a risky game that only a few people control, according to Barnard. 

?If you?re famous enough to get a Wikipedia page, it will bring you credibility. But if a person isn?t sufficiently notable, they don?t get a place on Wikipedia,? he says. ?Most CEOs of most companies wouldn?t get one.?","Barnard is a leading authority on the Google Knowledge Panel and began his digital career in 1998, coinciding with the founding of Google. Having witnessed the myriad changes in online self-expression over the decades - from personal websites to Wikipedia - all roads now lead to the Google Knowledge Panel. In the late 1990s, personal websites were primarily the domain of tech enthusiasts, Barnard said. That remained true when WordPress came along in 2003, which at the time was more of a blogging platform and didn't have the user-friendly site-building tools it's known for today. Myspace was a more popular means of online presence, topping the 2006 hit list of most visited websites in the U.S., surpassing both Google and Yahoo! Mail. Although Myspace has lost its place in social media, WordPress now powers nearly 40% of all online sites. In tandem with the platform's popularity, the popularity of personal websites has skyrocketed. By 2010, Barnard said, everyone who was serious about their online reputation had set up a personal website on WordPress, Squarespace or similar platforms. Still, personal websites often lack credibility, which is the essence of any online presence in today's saturated Internet environment. Since its inception two decades ago, Wikipedia has been the primary tool for establishing credibility online. However, the site's editorial processes and internal politics make it a risky venture controlled by a handful of people, Barnard said. ""If you have enough fame to justify a Wikipedia page, that increases credibility. But if someone doesn't meet the fame criterion, they don't get a spot on Wikipedia,"" he continues. ""Most corporate CEOs wouldn't qualify."" The key lesson here is to move from personal websites and Wikipedia to optimize online credibility to the less conventional but more powerful alternative - Google's Knowledge Panel.",1,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

While the brand's actual message may be relegated to a small image on the right-hand side of the search results page, the left-hand side is dominated by digital marketing content that may not accurately reflect the brand's message. Jason emphasizes that it's essential for businesses to take control of their Brand SERP and ensure that Google accurately represents their brand message.

Jason argues that Google wants to show users the most relevant, helpful, and useful information related to a brand when they search for it. Therefore, it's up to businesses to demonstrate through their Videos, Twitter Boxes, Contact Pages, and Newsletter Pages that they have valuable content that is relevant to their audience. By doing so, they can ensure that Google accurately reflects their brand message and showcases links to their website, sitelinks to login pages, and contact pages that are useful to the user. In short, Jason believes that businesses can control their brand's message on Google by creating content that is helpful and valuable to their audience and ensuring that Google understands their brand message.","Brand SERP expert, Jason Barnard, notes that Google searches for a brand name can often yield inconsistent brand messages that may not align with the carefully cultivated image the company presents on its website and social platforms. He underscores the crucial need for businesses to manage their Brand SERP judiciously to ensure that Google delivers an authentic representation of their brand message. Jason posits that Google's algorithm is designed to provide users with the most pertinent and helpful information related to a brand during a search. Thus, it's incumbent on businesses to create and showcase valuable content through their Videos, Twitter Boxes, Contact Pages, and Newsletter Pages that cater to their audience's interests and queries. This approach can guide Google to accurately reflect their brand message and highlight useful links to their website, plus pertinent sitelinks like login and contact pages. In essence, Jason's view is that by generating audience-centric, valuable content and making sure that Google comprehends their brand narrative, businesses can effectively control the portrayal of their brand on Google.",2,17,2023-03-22 11:59:31

If you see something amiss on your Google Knowledge Panel, you can also send feedback directly to Google employees. However, only suggest a change that?s factual in nature; they?re unlikely to change your main image simply because you don?t like how you look, Barnard says. 

With the recession looming, entrepreneurs are being more strategic than ever about where to spend their time and energy in the New Year.

By doing so, you can control how your brand is displayed online by the world?s most credible source.","Certain Google Knowledge Panels offer the option to be claimed - if this is possible for you, you'll see a ""Claim this Knowledge Panel"" button.

If there are any discrepancies in your Google Knowledge Panel, you have the option to provide feedback directly to Google. However, remember that changes should be based on factual discrepancies, not personal preference - an unattractive main image, for example, wouldn't be a valid reason for a change.

If you?re tweeting like mad and you don?t have Twitter boxes on your Brand SERP, it means that Google doesn?t see that your audience is engaging. It doesn?t see them as valuable, because what it presents on your Brand SERP is what it thinks is going to be valuable, helpful to your audience. So if you are tweeting and you don?t have the Twitter boxes, it means that Google doesn?t see that as being valuable and helpful to your audience, which implies that your Twitter strategy is misfiring.   Then you can look at video boxes. Once again, if you?re investing in video but Google isn?t showing that video on your Brand SERP, it implies that Google doesn?t see them as being important, helpful, and valuable to your audience, which means either the videos are not very good or Google is simply not seeing that engagement. It doesn?t understand that your audience are actually using and enjoying these videos.   So, either way, either you need to boost up your video strategy or think about how your users are engaging, on what platforms, is it truly relevant. So, all of these are great insights into what you are doing right and wrong in your content strategy in the wider sense.","Components of a successful Brand SERP include Twitter boxes and Video boxes that point to a strong Twitter and video strategy. If your Brand SERP does not include these boxes, despite frequent tweets and videos, it suggests that Google does not see your content as valuable or helpful to your audience. If the Twitter boxes are missing, it suggests that your Twitter concept is not successful, even though you may be an avid Twitterer. Similarly, if your video content is not showing up in your Brand SERP. This indicates that either the quality of your videos is poor or Google is not recognizing the engagement they generate.

Jason points out that Amazon's machine encyclopedia doesn't have the same concept of notability that Wikipedia has, as it wants to understand absolutely everything. In contrast, Google's Knowledge Graph is more limited in its understanding of products but has a better understanding of the wider world.

Jason finds it interesting that these two Knowledge Graphs are coming together, and he emphasizes the importance of educating not just Google, but also Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, all of which are developing their own machine learning systems. He sees these companies as ""children"" in terms of their understanding of the world, and he believes that it is vital to educate them so that they can better understand the world and help users find what they are looking for.","Discussing the distinctions between Amazon's and Google's Knowledge Graphs, Jason Barnard notes that Amazon's Knowledge Graph is primarily product-centric, while Google's encompasses a wider worldview. Unlike Wikipedia, Amazon's machine-led encyclopedia lacks a rigid concept of notability as it strives to understand everything extensively. On the other hand, Google's Knowledge Graph has a deeper comprehension of the global landscape, though it fares passably in its understanding of products. Jason observes and finds the convergence of these two Knowledge Graphs intriguing. He stresses the significance of imparting education to not just Google but also Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple, all of which are advancing their proprietary machine learning systems. Jason perceives these companies as nascent ""children"" in regard to their world comprehension and underlines the importance of teaching them to augment their understanding. This, he believes, is essential for helping users efficiently locate what they're seeking.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:43:22

What is astonishing is that Google not only recognizes that they are the same person but also adapts search results for Dr. Mike and Mike Varshavski according to user intent. Google understands the difference in the user's information needs based on the search term used. When the user searches for ""Dr. Mike,"" Google prioritizes results about him as a YouTube personality and physician. However, when the user searches for his real name ""Mike Varshavski,"" Google prioritizes information about him as a person rather than a star. Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP for Dr. Mike, which shows that Google understands that this person is a YouTube personality and provides different angles of information about him depending on the search term used.","Dr. Mike, an acclaimed American YouTuber, is the alias of Mike Varshavski, a practicing physician. Significantly, Google not just identifies these two as the same person but also tailors their search results according to user intent. It discerns the variance in a user's informational requirements based on the specific search query. If a user searches for ""Dr. Mike,"" Google highlights results linked to his identity as a YouTube personality and medical professional. Conversely, if users search for ""Mike Varshavski,"" it accentuates results related to him as an individual, rather than a celebrity. Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), while examining the Brand SERP for Dr. Mike, notes Google's ability to understand this same individual's distinctively different personas and to present varying perspectives about him based on the user's search query.",2,17,2023-02-15 12:14:44

Events are given special treatment in the Knowledge Graph and can easily trigger a Knowledge Panel. This treatment is even more pronounced when an event is part of an EventSeries, such as Kalicube Tuesdays. This preferential treatment for events became noticeable in Spring 2020 when Covid restrictions impacted events worldwide, and Google aimed to provide the most current event information.","During the planning of the Kalicube Tuesdays series, Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) consistently analyzes the duration required to prompt a Knowledge Panel on Google's SERP following the event's announcement. He notes that the Knowledge Graph exhibits a special inclination towards events, making it easier for them to trigger a Knowledge Panel. The annotation becomes more evident when an event is a part of a series like Kalicube Tuesdays. The favorable bias towards events became obvious in Spring 2020 as Covid restrictions affected global events, and Google's aim shifted towards providing the latest event updates.",2,17,2023-02-15 09:02:40

Jason Barnard notes that the content that is currently ranking is doing so because Google deems it valuable to the audience, and so the solution is to find or create content that is even more valuable and useful. By finding content on page two that is more valuable than the negative content and indicating to Google that it is so, it will rise in the rankings and push the negative content down. This can be achieved through owned or semi-owned content, such as social channels.

To effectively manage the Brand SERP, it's important to take proactive steps to build a positive online reputation. This can include creating high-quality content that is optimized for search engines, building a strong social media presence, and actively managing online reviews. By consistently producing valuable content and engaging with customers on social media, brands can build a positive image that will help to push negative content down the rankings. Additionally, it's important to be proactive in addressing any negative reviews or content and taking steps to resolve any issues that may have led to them.","Effectively managing Brand SERPs calls for addressing any potential negative content, which is essential for online reputation management. According to Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), the solution to negative content is not in simply generating massive amounts of new content. Instead, we must understand that Google ranks content based on its perceived usefulness to the audience. Therefore, our focus should be on creating or identifying even more valuable content that can rank higher and push down the negative content. This process involves identifying prime content on the second page of search results that holds greater value than the negative content, and indicating its merit to Google. Consequently, the valuable content will rise within the ranks, thus lowering the position of less desirable content. This can be effectuated through owned or semi-owned platforms such as social media channels. A proactive approach is crucial in managing Brand SERPs, encompassing the creation of top-tier, search engine optimized content, building a formidable social media identity, as well as actively managing online reviews. Through steady production of noteworthy content and customer engagement via social media, brands can foster a positive image, thereby lowering the rank of negative content. It's also pivotal to rectify any negative reviews or content proactively by resolving their underlying issues.",2,17,2023-02-16 10:47:41

You need to separate yourself from your company. Whether you are the sole proprietor or there are multiple people involved, your company is distinct from you as an individual.

Jason Barnard also said that it is important to educate Google about the nature of your company, its services, and the target audience, as well as about yourself, your role, and your own target audience. Although the audiences and the topics are likely to overlap, it is essential to recognize that they are separate entities. This is the first step.","Entrepreneurs, speakers and coaches who want to improve their Brand SERPs can take several important steps, as Jason Barnard suggests. First, they need to distinguish between their personal identity and their company's identity. This is true regardless of company size or ownership. Recognizing companies and individuals as unique entities is an important first step. After making this important distinction, they should focus on clearly communicating to Google the specifics of their business, including its character, the services it offers, and its target audience. The same clarity should apply to personal details such as function and individual target audience. Despite the likely overlap between these topics and audiences, it is important to consider them as separate entities. This approach not only ensures an appropriate focus on each entity, but also helps Google better understand the relationship between them, which is essential to improving their Brand SERPs.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00
759,Jason Bespoke,,How to make your podcast THE authority in your industry with a simple process that requires no geeky expertise.,"Firstly, when you Google the name of your podcast, what do you expect and want to see? Your mental list should perfectly align with what Google chooses for your Brand SERP. On this page, Google shows its recommendations about you to your audience. Google selects results that are helpful, valuable, and relevant to your audience. So, step one of your strategy is to work on the platforms you want to rank, and also those that are working for your competition (check their Brand SERPs).

Secondly, look at the right-hand side of the search results page. This is where Google displays facts and is where you want it to display who you are, what you do, and which audience you serve. This is the Knowledge Panel, a special case for podcasts. The information here needs to be accurate and deep, so look at successful podcasts like ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend"" for inspiration. A Knowledge Panel is the first HUGE step that shows you are climbing the stairs to authority. For that, you need to get the facts into Google's brain. Create a dedicated, owned webpage that represents your podcast, called the Entity Home. Ensure all existing sources corroborate this information, and add your podcast to relevant, authoritative sources.

Thirdly, work on your podcast at episode-level. Focus on creating high-quality content for each episode with clear titles, descriptions, and unique artwork. Invite recognized authorities in hyper-sub-niches of your niche as guests.

Google is the best performance indicator, but all platforms work the same way. They will favor you based on consistency, quality, and relationships with leading authorities in your niche.

Follow these steps and become the go-to authoritative podcast in your industry. ","Firstly, when you search your podcast's name on Google, it's important to assess if the results are in line with your expectations. The information revealed in your Brand SERP should accurately reflect your brand, as Google's suggestions represent your podcast to your audience. It's essential to optimize the platforms you want to rank and take cues from your successful competitors.

Next, focus on the right-hand side of the search results page where Google displays the Knowledge Panel ? an aggregation of facts about your podcast. For inspiration on how to enrich this panel, consider looking at popular podcasts like ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend"". Obtaining a Knowledge Panel symbolizes your ascent towards authority in Google's indexing. To facilitate this, you need to communicate the facts about your podcast to Google's algorithms. Develop an authoritative, standalone webpage that encapsulates your podcast, referred to as the Entity Home. Collaborate with existing sources to confirm the accuracy of the information and integrate your podcast into influential, domain-specific platforms.

Finally, pay special attention to each podcast episode. Strive for quality content with succinct titles, detailed descriptions, and unique artwork for each episode. Welcome noted authorities within your niche as guests to foster meaningful dialogues. Note that Google operates as the primary performance indicator, though all platforms generally function alike. They assess your standing based on consistency, quality, and relationships with authority figures within your field. Adhere to these steps to ascend to the position of a trusted authority within your podcast niche.",1,17,2023-03-26 11:48:17

For example, the logos for Google Podcast and Google My Business are human-curated, meaning that humans put the information together, making it likely to be true. Google then moved on to crowdsourcing, which involves multiple people coming together to create well-organized databases and information lists such as IMDb or Wikipedia. Google uses the manually curated and crowdsourced data to train the machine to understand and evaluate data from the World Wide Web. However, the data from the World Wide Web is not human-curated, and anyone can put anything on the web, so there is no inherent reliability in that information.","Google has been establishing a form of human-like comprehension of the world by incorporating manual curation, crowdsourcing, and data from the internet,"" as stated by Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy).

This denotes that humans assembled this data, making it probable to be accurate. Later, Google ventured into crowdsourcing, a process where a group of individuals collectively create well-structured databases and informational lists like IMDb or Wikipedia. Google employs this manually curated and crowdsourced information to educate its machine learning systems, enabling them to assess and comprehend data from the World Wide Web.

Jason compares the questions asked in New York to those asked in Canada and notes that while New Yorkers ask ""Who is Natasha Romanoff in love with?"", Canadians ask ""Who is Black Widow in love with?"". He also points out that the phrasing of the question ""Does Black Widow die?"" differs between the two countries. This shows that people's approach to searching for information can change depending on their cultural background and regional differences.

Amazon's SERP includes the company name at the top, Twitter boxes, Top Stories, Related Searches, and a Knowledge Panel on the right. Jason notes that Amazon's shift to branding is evident in their recent update to their homepage title tag.

Jason highlights that Amazon's previous title tag, ""Low prices on electronics, books, sports equipment & more,"" focused on selling products, while the new title tag, ""Amazon.com. Spend less. Smile more,"" emphasizes branding. He notes that this change marks a shift from pure selling to selling on the back of the Amazon brand. Jason also points out that Cyrus Shepherd identified this change on June 4th, 2021, which he considers a significant date in SEO history.

Jason believes that it is essential for big companies to recognize the importance of filling their meta title on the homepage for branding purposes, not just selling products. He notes that the meta title is an opportunity for companies to brand themselves to potential customers, prospects, and existing clients. By doing so, companies can create a lasting impression and foster customer loyalty.

In conclusion, Jason highlights the importance of branding in today's digital landscape, and how companies like Amazon are recognizing this shift. The meta title on the homepage is a valuable tool for companies to build their brand and connect with their audience. By focusing on branding and customer loyalty, companies can create a lasting impact and build a competitive advantage in their respective industries.","In his discussion about the Brand SERP of Amazon, a powerhouse of ecommerce, Jason Barnard, the professional ""Brand SERP Guy"", analyzes the elements that compose Amazon's SERP including the company name, Twitter widgets, Top Stories, Related Searches, and a Knowledge Panel. He spotlights Amazon's branding strategy which is evident in their recent modification of the homepage title tag. Previously, Amazon's title tag was centric on selling products: ""Low prices on electronics, books, sports equipment & more."" But the tweaked title tag, ""Amazon.com. Spend less. Smile more,"" denotes a focus on branding. This change, according to Jason, signifies a transition from straightforward selling to selling efforts backed by the Amazon brand. Jason credits Cyrus Shepherd for pointing out this shift on June 4th, 2021, a date he regards as momentous within the SEO community. He advocates for large corporations to acknowledge the value of utilizing their homepage's meta title towards branding, rather than merely product selling. The meta title affords companies a chance to establish their brand image with potential clientele, prospects, and existing patrons, bolstering brand recall and customer fidelity. In summary, Jason underscores the rising prominence of branding in the digital arena, evidenced by companies like Amazon prioritizing this transformation. The homepage meta title presents companies with a potent tool to cultivate brand recognition and reach out to audiences. A branding focus, coupled with customer loyalty, empowers businesses to establish a lasting impact and gain a competitive edge in their respective sectors.",2,17,2023-02-20 10:17:39
745,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/jason-barnard-a-universal-strategy-for-answer-engine-optimisation/,"An Example of a Knowledge Graph and the Future of Nodes, Related Nodes, and Attributes","In his discussion of the Knowledge Graph, Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of human-curated sources, such as IMDb, MusicBrainz, and Wikipedia, which provide the labeled data that Google's supervised machine learning can use to create related answers. He uses William Shatner as an example, pointing out that Google knows about his music, films, and TV shows because of the human-curated sources. Jason suggests that this is what will happen to companies in the future - Google will have the confidence to show all the information about them, including sub-organisations, divisions, products, offers, and the chairman of the board, all linked through nodes with attributes to create a comprehensive Knowledge Panel.

Jason notes that this approach to the Knowledge Graph is still semi-supervised, but as machine learning becomes more sophisticated, the nodes and related nodes will become increasingly comprehensive, providing a more complete picture of a company's attributes and relationships. He concludes that the Knowledge Graph will allow companies to dig down and find related answers, just as users can currently do with William Shatner's films and TV shows.","In his discussion about the Knowledge Graph, Jason Barnard highlights the crucial role of human-curated sources like IMDb, MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. These sources provide labelled data, which is used by Google's supervised machine learning to generate relevant answers. Using William Shatner as an example, Jason points out that Google is able to generate information about Shatner's music, movies, and TV shows thanks to these curated sources. He proposes that a similar scenario will apply to businesses in the future, where Google will exhibit extensive information about them, including subsidiary organizations, divisions, products, offers, and key personnel. This information will be linked via nodes and attributes, creating a detailed Knowledge Panel. While this state of the Knowledge Graph uses semi-supervised learning, Jason predicts that with the advancement of machine learning, the nodes and related nodes will become increasingly expansive, yielding a more holistic representation of a company's characteristics and affiliations. He wraps up by suggesting that the Knowledge Graph will enable businesses to delve into and unearth related answers, much akin to how users can presently explore William Shatner's films and TV shows.",2,17,2023-03-24 19:39:10
592,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/person/dan-sharp/,Finding Dan Sharp?s Hidden Knowledge Panel,"Jason Barnard examines the Brand SERP for Dan Sharp. While Jason knows Dan Sharp as the founder of Screaming Frog, he discovers that there are multiple individuals with the same name, including a musical artist and a journalist who attended Liverpool University. Interestingly, Google recognizes that the Dan Sharp associated with Screaming Frog could be the one being searched for, but his Knowledge Panel does not appear in search results for his name. However, by using the Kalicube Knowledge Graph Explorer, Jason is able to locate Dan Sharp's Knowledge Panel.

The key takeaway from this video is that having a Knowledge Panel does not guarantee that it will appear in search results for your name. Despite Google recognizing the entity being searched for, the right rail of the search results may not display the Knowledge Panel. This highlights the importance of optimizing your Brand SERP to ensure that the most relevant and accurate information appears in search results for your name.","In his evaluation of Dan Sharp's Brand SERP, Jason Barnard notes that there are other individuals with identical names, including a musician and a journalist from Liverpool University. However, Jason is knowledgeable about Dan Sharp's role as the founder of Screaming Frog. Despite Google recognizing the Screaming Frog's Dan Sharp, its Knowledge Panel does not materialize in searches for his name. Surprisingly, Jason finds Dan Sharp's Knowledge Panel using the Kalicube Knowledge Graph Explorer. This video underscores the message that possessing a Knowledge Panel isn't a guarantee that it will be visible in name-related search results. The right side of the search results might not showcase the Knowledge Panel, even when Google identifies the entity in question. This scenario emphasizes the need for optimal Brand SERP, ensuring the most pertinent and accurate data appears when your name is in search results.",2,17,2023-03-19 09:12:32

He notes that although the company has a good Google My Business profile and positive reviews, their Brand SERP is boring because it only displays blue links on the right-hand side. Jason suggests that Cornish Lawns should consider developing a content strategy that includes image and video boxes to make their Brand SERP more visually appealing and impressive to their audience.","In his evaluation of the Brand SERP for Cornish Lawns, a small firm situated in Bodmin, England, Jason Barnard highlights a noticeable flaw. Despite owning a well-compiled Google My Business profile coupled with favourable reviews, the firm's Brand SERP appears rather dull as it merely showcases blue links on the right-hand side.

He expresses his fondness for the book's title and discusses the Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side of the page, which appeared quickly after the book's release. However, he focuses on the left-hand side of the SERP, where Google provides highly specific information about the book's dimensions, publisher, publication date, and price in dollars, despite Jason being in the UK. While this information may not be interesting to him, Jason notes that it is essential for potential buyers and emphasizes that Google's goal is to provide as much information as possible to help users make informed purchasing decisions.","In his examination of the Brand SERP for the newly launched children's book, ""Hamsters Make Terrible Roommates,"" Jason Barnard, known as 'The Brand SERP Guy,' highlights various interesting aspects.

Although this data may not pique Jason's own interest, he acknowledges its essential role for potential purchasers. He underscores Google's commitment to supplying all-encompassing information to guide users in their buying decisions.

He notes that the term SPAM is ubiquitous and has multiple meanings, including junk email. The left-hand rail of the page includes disambiguation results, and SPAM the meat product has done a good job of managing their Brand SERP by providing recipes that drown out the alternative meaning. Meanwhile, Google offers disambiguation results on the right-hand side to direct users to email spam and spamming.

Jason also discusses the origin of the term SPAM, which comes from a Monty Python sketch where every item on the menu in a greasy spoon caf has SPAM in it. The sketch is famous, and there is a Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side that explains more about it. Jason highlights the importance of managing a Brand SERP, particularly when the brand name has multiple meanings or is easily confused with other terms. By providing relevant and useful content, brands can optimize their presence on search engines and ensure that their target audience finds them easily.","In his exploration of the Brand SERP for SPAM, Jason Barnard notes the challenge the term poses due to its various meanings, notably referencing junk email. To distinguish its product, SPAM (the meat), has successfully managed its Brand SERP to overshadow alternative interpretations by offering recipe content that dominates the page. For further clarification, Google provides disambiguation results on both sides of the page, guiding users towards more context on either 'email spam' or 'spamming'. Interestingly, the genesis of 'SPAM' originates in a Monty Python sketch about a caf serving dishes exclusively featuring SPAM. This is well-documented in a Knowledge Panel on the page's right-hand side. Jason accentuates the significance of effective Brand SERP management, especially for brands with names that could be easily conflated with other meanings. By delivering pertinent and helpful content, brands can optimize their search engine presence, making it easier for their targeted audience to discover them.

594,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/person/dmitry-gerasimenko/,Why Google Needs an Entity Home Page for Dmitry Gerasimenko,"Jason Barnard examines the Brand SERP for Dmitry Gerasimenko, the founder of Ahrefs, and highlights the issue of Google getting confused when there are multiple entities on one page. Despite having tagged photos with Alt Tags, Google is still displaying the wrong photo for Dmitry in the People Also Ask section. Jason suggests that one solution could be to use a figure tag with semantic HTML5 or add meta information to the photo itself. However, the larger problem is Google's preference for one entity per page, which can lead to inaccurate information extraction.

To solve this problem, Jason suggests creating individual pages for each person, which would make it easier for Google to extract accurate information. This underscores the importance of creating and maintaining a clear online presence to ensure that Google displays accurate information on the Brand SERP. By taking steps to optimize personal branding, individuals can ensure that they are represented accurately on search engine results pages, which can help to enhance their reputation and authority in their respective fields.","In his review of Ahrefs founder Dmitry Gerasimenko's Brand SERP, Jason Barnard highlights the complication that arises when multiple entities exist on the same page, causing Google to occasionally misinterpret data. Despite the use of Alt Tags on photographs, Google continues to display the wrong image of Dmitry in the People Also Ask segment. Jason proposes potential solutions, like employing a figure tag alongside semantic HTML5 or adding metadata directly to the image. However, a more prominent issue lies with Google's tendency to favor single entities per page, potentially leading to imprecise data extraction. To rectify this, Jason suggests the development of separate pages for each individual, streamlining the process of Google accurately pulling information. This situation emphasizes the need for a distinct and well-structured online presence to guarantee accurate information representation on Brand SERP. Through personal branding optimization steps, individuals can reinforce their accurate representation on search engine results pages, subsequently improving their reputation and influence within their specific fields.",2,17,2023-03-19 09:25:15

Jason notes that the SERP has an interesting feature where one of the top questions is about why Kinney wrote the book. He praises the representation of Kinney's Twitter account through Twitter Boxes but points out that the Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side lacks an entity home, which could help Kinney better control his Brand SERP.

Jason advises Kinney to claim the Knowledge Panel before someone else does to gain more control over what appears on the SERP. Claiming the Knowledge Panel would allow Kinney to better control the information that appears on the left-hand side in conjunction with his main website. Overall, Jason's analysis highlights the importance of taking control of one's Brand SERP and utilizing tools like an entity home to better manage one's online presence.","In his scrutiny of Jeff Kinney's personal Brand SERP, author of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jason Barnard observes a unique feature. One of the most frequently asked questions ponders why Kinney penned the book. Jason commends the visibility of Kinney's Twitter profile through Twitter Boxes, but draws attention to the absence of an entity home in the Knowledge Panel situated on the right-hand side. This could be a resource for Kinney to better govern his Brand SERP. Jason recommends Kinney assert ownership of the Knowledge Panel to prevent others from doing so, consequently acquiring more influence over SERP content. Ownership of the Knowledge Panel would enable Kinney to have a higher level of control over the data appearing on the left-hand side, together with his primary website. In summation, Jason's dissection emphasizes the importance of seizing control of one's Brand SERP, applying tools like an entity home for the superior management of one's digital footprint.",2,17,2023-03-20 07:07:28

He notes that many international brands, including KitKat, seem to have a problem with their Meta Description, which is the description on their page that Google uses to generate the search result snippet. However, Jason's focus is on the branding of the page, specifically the use of the color red.

Jason points out that KitKat has done an excellent job of branding with the color red. The KitKat logo, products, Twitter Boxes, recipes, and even the chocolate bars are all red. This consistent use of color creates a cohesive and memorable brand image on the search results page. While there may be room for improvement in their Meta Description, KitKat's use of color demonstrates the importance of branding and how it can make a brand stand out in a crowded search results page.","In his video analysis, Jason Barnard highlights the impressive branding strategy KitKat employs on its Brand SERP. Despite a potential problem with the brand's meta-description, Jason focuses primarily on the remarkable use of color. Branding with the color red has been a huge success for KitKat.

Slack's Homepage is at the top of the results, along with rich Site Links, People Also Ask section, and a detailed Knowledge Panel on the right. However, Jason observes that the user experience in New York is not optimal, as Google shows two office locations in the map pack, which is unlikely to be what the user is searching for. He suggests that Slack could try to close one of the Google My Business listings to make it less visible.

Overall, there is not much Slack can do to improve their Brand SERP. They have already done a good job of managing it with the information provided in the Knowledge Panel and other sections. The only area of improvement would be the user experience in the map pack, which can be resolved by making one of the Google My Business listings less visible.","In Jason Barnard's assessment of Slack's Brand SERP, he commends the significant presence of elements like the Homepage, Rich Site Links, a comprehensive Knowledge Panel, and a People Also Ask section. But, he points out an anomaly with the Map Pack showing two office locations when searched from New York, likely not a relevant result for users. His recommendation to Slack is to possibly de-emphasize one of the Google My Business listings to enhance user experience. Although Slack's control and management over its Brand SERP is remarkable and leaves little room for improvement, addressing this minor issue with the Map Pack could fine-tune user experience on their Brand SERP even further.",2,17,2023-03-21 14:19:37

Jason notes that the filters, in the form of lozenges or pills, allow users to refine their search by sending them through to video results with the additional filter added.

Jason emphasizes the importance of optimizing videos so that Google can understand their content and correctly display them on the Brand SERP. With the increasing use of filters on Brand SERPs, it is important for businesses to ensure that they dominate their own Brand SERP and appear on filters for their competitors' Brand SERPs.

462,Transcript,https://kalicube.com/learning-spaces/talks-and-presentations/brand-serps-talks/brand-serp-optimisation-with-jason-barnard/,Google's Granular Knowledge of What Appeals to Your Audience Varies Based on Geographical Location,"According to Jason Barnard, optimizing your brand's SERP is crucial. He shared an experience with a client who had a page about Land Rover, but it was popping up globally because they had not made it clear that it was specific to Land Rover. After sorting out the ambiguity, the page continued to appear in the UK due to the client being pre-installed in Land Rover, which had a hundred thousand pre-installs. Jason emphasized that Google has a granular understanding of what is relevant to audiences based on their geographic location.

Jason also stressed the importance of understanding that your homepage is not a destination in itself, but rather a stepping stone to somewhere else. This is crucial when considering sitelinks, which are links that appear under the main website result in a SERP. Sitelinks are given a high level of importance because they provide direct access to specific pages within a website, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

In summary, optimizing your brand's SERP is important, and it's essential to make it clear what your pages are about to avoid ambiguity. It's also important to understand that your homepage is not a destination, but rather a means to an end. Sitelinks are an important tool for providing direct access to specific pages within a website and should be given careful consideration. Finally, it's worth noting that Google has a granular understanding of what is relevant to audiences based on their geographic location, and this should be taken into account when optimizing your SERP.","In Jason Barnard's viewpoint, the optimization of a brand's SERP is of utmost importance. During a past client interaction, an issue arose where a page about Land Rover was not geographically specific and therefore appeared globally. Once they resolved this ambiguity, the page still featured prominently in the UK due to the client's pre-installs in Land Rover, amounting to a hundred thousand. This incident underscored the sophistication of Google's ai, which determined relevance based on geographical location. Jason reiterated the significance of viewing a homepage not as an end destination but as a conduit to other areas. This perspective is particularly important when managing sitelinks - those links presented beneath the primary website result on a SERP. Because sitelinks expedite user access to precise pages within a website, their relevance is elevated. In essence, brand SERP optimization is vital, with emphasis on clarity regarding the purpose of webpages and an understanding that a homepage functions as a gateway, not a terminus. The role of sitelinks as an essential tool for directing users to specific website sections should also be contemplated. Ultimately, acknowledging Google's geographically sensitive relevance discernment can serve to enhance SERP optimization.",2,17,2023-02-27 07:19:33

What's even more interesting is the Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side, which John Fuller needs to claim.

While triggering a Knowledge Panel for a brand on Google may seem like the end goal, Kalicube aims to go beyond that by making brands the most significant influencer of all the information displayed on Google's Knowledge Panel. To achieve this, it is essential to identify the sources that Google trusts, which can be accomplished by having a solid Entity Home and understanding those trusted sources.

According to Jason Barnard, one of the first steps in establishing an online presence is identifying the entity, which can be a brand, service, product, CEO, podcast, or even an individual. The next step is to designate an Entity Home, which is a canonical page that serves as the primary source of information about the entity on the internet. This page serves as a reference point for Google's algorithms to better understand and categorize the entity.

To help Google better understand the entity and its context, the information on the Entity Home page must be clearly and factually presented. This information should include a simple and clear explanation of what the entity is, what it does, and who its intended audience is. Once this information has been added to the page, it's time to use Schema Markup to make it more easily digestible for Google's algorithms. While Schema Markup may seem tedious, there are many tools available that can make the process easier. Jason Barnard recommends using WordLift, an Italian company that specializes in semantic SEO, to write Schema Markup for a better understanding of the entity by Google.

To further bolster Google's understanding of the entity, the Schema Markup must be placed in Google's native language. This means that the structured data must be written in a way that is easy for Google's algorithms to understand. Once the Schema Markup has been written, it's important to link the Entity Home page to other sources online that support the information presented. This can be achieved through the use of sameAs, which links to other sources online that corroborate the entity's details. By following these steps, businesses and individuals can improve their chances of being included in the Knowledge Graph, increasing their online visibility and authority.","In the digital landscape, cultivating a robust online persona is crucial for both businesses and individuals alike. Guided by Jason Barnard's advice, the initial stage of forming online visibility revolves around identifying the entity; this could be anything from a company, product, or service to a CEO, an individual, or a podcast. The proceeding action involves designating an 'Entity Home', a principal page that acts as the chief source of knowledge about the entity online. This page aids Google's algorithms in a better understanding and categorization of the entity.

In assisting Google to grasp the entity and its context more effectively, the accuracy and clarity of the information provided on the 'Entity Home' page are necessary. This info should incorporate a brief, straightforward elucidation of the entity's characteristics, its functions, and its target demographic. Once this data is inputted, the next phase entails leveraging Schema Markup to make it simpler for Google's algorithms to decode.

Despite seeming laborious, Schema Markup can be facilitated by using various tools. Jason Barnard proposes using WordLift?an Italian firm that excels in semantic SEO? to draft Schema Markup for improved comprehension of the entity by Google. To further reinforce Google's understanding of the entity, it's advised to present the Schema Markup in Google's 'native language', implying that the organized data needs to be crafted in a manner easily deciphered by Google's algorithms.

Following the creation of the Schema Markup, it's vital to connect the 'Entity Home' page to other online sources that validate the disclosed information. This can be achieved by applying the 'sameAs' property, creating links to other online sources that confirm the entity's specifics.

By observing these measures, both businesses and individuals can enhance their likelihood of inclusion in the Knowledge Graph, thereby elevating their online visibility and credibility.",2,17,2023-02-16 17:22:20

The formula is then fed into Google's algorithms, which attempt to replicate the results. Jason Barnard seeks to achieve the same goal of understanding facts using his own methodology, adapting the formula to find new ways to understand facts. However, this can be dangerous, as the machine may become wild. Therefore, the results are checked by humans, who provide corrective data. The engineers can then tweak the algorithm to make it more efficient and accurate in finding the facts. The most important aspect here is to ensure the accuracy of the facts.","In the words of Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy), here's a simplified explanation of how machine learning operates: An engineer formulates a mathematical equation that processes data to yield the required results. This equation is then inputted into Google's algorithms which endeavor to reproduce these outcomes. Barnard also aims to grasp this understanding of facts by adjusting the equation in his own unique way to discern new methods of fact comprehension. Nevertheless, this can pose risks as the machine may spiral out of control. Hence, humans intervene to verify the results and provide rectifying data. Consequently, engineers may adjust the algorithm to enhance its efficiency and correctness in fact identification. The paramount importance here is the assurance of fact accuracy.",2,17,2023-02-14 12:27:00

The number one thing that most brands or a lot of brands miss is the Rich Sitelinks right underneath the homepage, getting those Rich Sitelinks with the blue link and the description, the little snippets. 55% of brands have them, 45% don?t. That?s nuts. And as soon as you see that your brand doesn?t have them, not only does it show you that your audience is not getting a great user experience.   Because the idea of those Rich Sitelinks is that your audience, who are a subset of Google?s users, who are searching for your brand name, can then click through to the login page, to the blog page, to the About Us page, to the employment page, whatever it might be. And Google is trying to give them that direct access, so they don?t have to go through the homepage.   Now, if you don?t have them, it?s a sign that Google doesn?t understand your site properly. And that?s a fundamental SEO issue. If it hasn?t understood your site well enough to give you those sitelinks that it really wants to give you if it can, you have a site structure issue. So, what I?ve been doing as well is looking at Brand SERPs to analyse major SEO issues like that. That?s just one example.","Incorporating rich sitelinks directly below your brand's homepage on your Brand SERP is a concept that many brands unfortunately overlook. These Sitelinks - easily recognizable as blue links with small descriptive snippets - are incredibly useful for users, and yet only present for 55% of brands: That's pretty amazing given their importance.

Rich Sitelinks facilitate a smooth user experience for your audience, which is a subset of Google's users, especially those googling your brand name. They provide direct access to important areas of your website such as the login page, blog page, About Us page, contact page, or employment page. This feature saves users from going through the homepage and makes SERP-to-site navigation much easier and user-friendly.

However, if Rich Sitelinks are missing from your Brand SERP, it could be a sign that Google is having trouble properly understanding the structure of your website. This is a fundamental SEO issue, meaning that if Google doesn't understand your site well enough to add these sitelinks, your site's structure might need to be reworked. ",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

However, obtaining them can be a challenge and requires the following:

1. Your brand must be image-friendly (so things like ice cream and clothing are good candidates, while SaaS companies could have a harder time).
2. You must have a diverse collection of high-quality images, both on your own site and on other sites, and they must be optimized for image search.

If you meet the first requirement, to get images to appear on your brand's SERP, you should ensure that the images on your site are not only optimized, but also generate impressions and clicks. Additionally, you should help your partners in optimizing the branded images they display on their sites.","Integrating a set of engaging images into your Brand SERP can significantly increase its appeal, but achieving this can be a challenge. To do so requires certain prerequisites: first, your brand must inherently lend itself to visual representation; for example, consumer products such as clothing or ice cream are better suited than SaaS companies. Second, it's important to have a wide range of high-quality images on your website and elsewhere that are optimized for image search. If your brand meets the first requirement, you can optimize the visibility of these images on your Brand SERP by ensuring that they aren't only optimized, but also lead to impressions and clicks. Helping your partners optimize your brand's images on their websites can significantly increase the overall appeal of your Brand SERP.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Ebuyer example,"Having a search box for your website in Google is pretty cool. Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) is looking at the Brand SERP for Ebuyer. He does not know who they are, but they have a brand SERP, so Jason is interested. They have their website at the top. They have the rich site links. They have People Also Ask. They have their Twitter boxes and their Facebook page, and they have associated themselves with some of the big brands that they actually sell, which is great.

One interesting thing is the search box in the rich site links. Google's instructions describe exactly what to do, and it's all about installing schema markup. What is interesting here is that Ebuyer has not installed the schema markup recommended by Google, but still has the search box in the rich site links.

Google really likes the site. It understands it really well. And it has figured out what the search page is on that site. Jason would suggest that if you want to have one of these rich site links search boxes, you should follow Google's well-crafted instructions.","Introducing a search box to Google for your website is a remarkable achievement. Jason Barnard, known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"","" is fascinated by Ebuyer's Brand SERP, even though he does not know the brand. At first glance, Ebuyer's website ranks high in the Brand SERP. They have placed many links on the website, are featured in 'People Also Ask' and have included their Twitter boxes and Facebook page. The association with established brands that they sell is impressive.

One feature that stands out in Ebuyer's impressive set-up is the search box in the rich site links. According to Google, you need to install Schema Markup for this. But even without this Google-recommended practise, Ebuyer has kept the search box in its rich site links.

The reason for this could be that Google holds Ebuyer's website in high regard, understands it very well and has managed to recognise the search page on Ebuyer's website. To increase the likelihood of getting a search box in your rich site links, Jason Barnard recommends following Google's expertly crafted instructions.",2,17,2023-02-22 09:06:32

This has made the Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) the new equivalent of a business card. Having a bad, unconvincing, or negative SERP can hurt your brand's reputation and efforts in building a positive image.

Even when meeting someone in person and providing them with a business card, they will still search for you or your brand online later. Therefore, the first experience with your brand online becomes equivalent to a homepage. In Jason's experience, many searches on his brand name come from existing clients who are navigating to his site. Thus, your SERP becomes your homepage, and having a negative or unconvincing SERP will not only impact first-time impressions but also affect existing clients' perceptions.

Furthermore, local SEO experts such as Greg Gifford or Andy Simpson believe that, especially in local search, the SERP is equivalent to a homepage, as people rarely go to websites anymore but use Google to come to businesses physically. Therefore, a positive and convincing SERP becomes crucial in all cases, acting as both your business card and homepage.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) asserts that the common practice of individuals researching your name or brand online after first hearing about your company underscores the role of the Google Search Engine Results Page (SERP) as a modern business card. An unfavorable, unimpressive or negative SERP can detrimentally impact your brand's standing and efforts to cultivate a positive image. Even when personal interactions occur and business cards are exchanged, a supplemental online search for you or your brand is typically conducted. Consequently, the initial online encounter with your brand acts as a virtual homepage. Based on Jason's observations, a major portion of the searches on his brand name originate from his existing clientele trying to connect with his site. So, the SERP in essence becomes your homepage, and a negative or unimpressive SERP can taint not just the initial impressions but also influence perceptions of existing customers. Moreover, local SEO specialists like Greg Gifford and Andy Simpson opine that in the realm of local searches, the SERP functions as a homepage since people seldom visit websites directly but rather use Google for in-person business dealings.

He provides Google Maps as a good example of a massive Knowledge Graph that shows how it works. Essentially, Google Maps can solve A-to-B problems, and it can find the best solution for a query, determine how to get there, and do so in real-time by knowing a user's location and the locations of the businesses searched.

Additionally, the Knowledge Graph is capable of solving geospatial queries that it has never seen before in real-time. For instance, if a user is searching for a coffee shop that also sells tea, it will find the best solution and provide directions to it. The Knowledge Graph can do this because it has access to a wealth of data that allows it to provide accurate and up-to-date information in real-time.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) elaborates that having a Knowledge Graph is not about qualification or notability, but instead about Google's ability to comprehend information. Google Maps is cited as a comprehensive illustration of a functioning Knowledge Graph. Effectively, Google Maps is programmed to resolve A-to-B matters by finding optimal answers to a query, determining the route to the location, and executing this in real time, given its awareness of the user's current location and the localities of the searched businesses. Moreover, it's proficient in managing geospatial queries it hasn't encountered before, almost instantly.

The biggest mistake people make is assuming that once they rank number one, they don't need to do anything else. In reality, controlling the entire Brand SERP is crucial for shaping a brand's image and message.

It's not just about the homepage, but also about the Rich Sitelinks displayed underneath. If a site doesn't have them, it may mean that Google has misunderstood how the site is organized, making it harder for users to find relevant content.

The idea of winning the battle by ranking number one is a traditional SEO mentality, but in Brand SERPs, it's more about control. Another mistake people make is focusing solely on keyword stuffing on their homepage, when it should communicate who the brand is, what they do, and why they're a good solution for their audience.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) emphasizes that just obtaining the top spot in Google's search results doesn't equate to ultimate success. The grave mistake that individuals often make is to become complacent once they've secured the number one spot, assuming that no additional efforts are required. In truth, exercising control over the entirety of a Brand SERP is pivotal in molding a brand's image and communicating its message effectively. It's about more than just the home page - Rich Sitelinks that appear below also play a significant role. Their absence could suggest Google's inability to accurately grasp the site's structure, subsequently making it challenging for users to locate relevant content. Classically, the objective of SEO has been to secure a top ranking, but control is of utmost importance when it comes to Brand SERPs.

He gave an example of how he searched for social media publishing platforms such as Hootsuite, SocialPilot, and ContentCal. The information displayed on their Brand SERP had an impact on his opinion of the brands, and he suggested that others may also be influenced in the same way.

But My Projector Lamps named its company after its product - a tactic that was popular on the Internet in the noughties. Such a name was good for search engine optimization (SEO) and also made it easier for a brand to launch online, as people immediately knew what the company was selling. However, this has two major drawbacks. One is a confusing brand SERP, and the other is Google Ads - a large number of competitors aggressively bidding on your name, which means you have to pay a lot more to be at the top for *our own* brand name.

Jason examines the brand SERP for My Projector Lamps and he really just wants to explain why naming your business after the product you sell could be problematic. They dominate with an ad, they have that top spot, so everything seems fine, but actually a lot of people are asking questions around projector lamps.

And Google shows them because the term is still very ambiguous. It also shows several other stores. It also shows some reviews, but then it goes back to ambiguity with the videos. Then it shows some reviews again, and then it goes back down  with even more ambiguity. And the last problem that Jason wants to point out is that if you have a name that's pretty similar to the product that you are selling, you are going to face a lot of competition in your Google ads. So it's probably much more difficult and expensive for them than if they had a unique brand name.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) explains that while most businesses globally opt for unique names for their brands to create a distinct brand identity, My Projector Lamps named their company after its distinct product. This naming approach, popular in the early internet era, tended to boost search engine optimization and simplified the brand's online introduction, as customers immediately knew what was being sold. But this tactic comes with major drawbacks, namely a confounding brand SERP and high-cost Google Ads due to the vast competition for the same name resulting in paying a hefty price to maintain the top spot for the company's own brand name. In his analysis of My Projector Lamps' brand SERP, Barnard discovered that despite an ad securing the top spot, the brand faced potential issues due to the term ""projector lamps"" being highly ambiguous. The search results included numerous other stores, reviews, and videos that might confuse users, making the control of the brand's online presence more challenging. Lastly, Barnard highlights that companies naming themselves similar to the product they sell will face a high level of competition on Google ads, making the ad campaign more difficult and expensive than if they had a unique name.",2,17,2023-02-22 14:36:01

Despite sounding strange, Google Maps and local search are moving toward an algorithm based on entities, understanding, and confidence in comprehension. This algorithm aims to solve problems in real-time by providing users with the most appropriate solution through a human-like understanding of the world.

The concept of qualifying for the Knowledge Graph is similar because Google is primarily concerned with understanding the information, not necessarily the notability of the subject. In contrast, Wikipedia is a human encyclopedia that requires subjects to be notable to warrant an article. If someone's name or brand is not spontaneously looked up on Wikipedia, then having an article is not beneficial. However, for Google, understanding who a person or brand is, what they do, and their audience is what matters most.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) expresses his admiration for local search specialists like Greg Gifford, Claire Carlile, and Mike Blumenthal, who have consistently discussed the same themes. Interestingly, Google Maps and local search are evolving towards an algorithm rooted in entities, comprehension, and confidence in this understanding. This algorithm strives to address queries in real-time by offering the most suitable solution using a grasp of the world that mimics human cognition. The methodology for qualifying for the Knowledge Graph resembles this because Google is chiefly interested in comprehending the data, and not necessarily the prominence of the topic. On the other hand, Wikipedia, as a human encyclopedia, necessitates subjects to have a degree of notoriety to merit an article. If a person or brand isn't naturally searched for on Wikipedia, then possessing an article may not yield advantages.

He has been doing it for seven years. Jason was curious about how much control he had over the search results and found out that he could control a lot. When you search his name, Jason Barnard, on Google, the results primarily show him, making him look impressive because he has worked on it.

What Jason finds interesting is that there are 250 other Jason Barnards in the world, including a successful footballer in South Africa, but they don't show up in the search results. This demonstrates that you can take control of your personal Brand SERP and exclude others who share your name. In terms of your Brand SERP, which tends to be less ambiguous, you can take control and make it positive, accurate, and convincing. You can control what people see when they search your brand name.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) initiated the monitoring of his personal Brand SERP (which appears when his name is searched on Google) in 2013, and has maintained this practice for seven years. Intrigued by the degree of control he could exercise over these results, Barnard discovered that he had substantial influence. When you look up his name, Jason Barnard, the primary listings are focused on him, yielding a positive impression?a result of his active efforts. An interesting observation is that while there are 250 other individuals named Jason Barnard globally, including a well-known footballer in South Africa, they remain absent from the search outcomes. This illustrates the possibilities of gaining control over and molding one's personal Brand SERP and effectively pushing out other namesakes.

On the right rail of desktop, Google displays factual information that relies on its understanding of the user's search query, which is contained in the Knowledge Graph. These two aspects of the algorithm have been separate, but they are now merging, with factual information being integrated into the main algorithm increasingly.

According to Jason Barnard, Google's previous algorithm counted words and links to rank a site. However, with the Hummingbird update in 2015, Google aimed to understand the world instead of just counting words and links. In 2021, Jason believes that Google has finally achieved its goal of understanding the world, and its ability to represent the world in search engine results pages has become more important than ever.

Overall, it appears that Google's algorithm is evolving from a simple word and link-counting system to a more sophisticated understanding of the world. As Google integrates factual information from the Knowledge Graph into its main algorithm, it will likely become even more accurate at providing users with the best solutions and answers for their queries.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) proposes that Google's primary algorithm prioritizes ranking content on the left-hand side of the desktop screen, aligning with the goal of providing the most relevant responses to user inquiries. On the contrary, accurate information displayed on the right-hand side relies heavily on Google's comprehension of the search query as contained in the Knowledge Graph. Historically, these two elements of Google's algorithm have functioned separately. However, increasingly, factual information from the Knowledge Graph is being merged into the main algorithm. Previously, Google's algorithm focused on quantifying words and links to rank a website. But the 2015 Hummingbird update reflected Google's ambition to understand global concepts, rather than merely counting words and links. By 2021, Barnard considers Google to have effectively mastered global comprehension ? a development he contends is crucial for improving the representation of the world in Google's SERPs. Thus, Google's algorithm has seemingly progressed from a rudimentary system of counting words and links to comprehending the world in a more intricate manner. As the integration of Knowledge Graph factual data into its main algorithm continues, Google is likely to enhance its proficiency in delivering the most pertinent solutions and answers to user queries.",2,17,2023-02-16 12:11:33

The first sign he identified is if you only have 10 blue links on your SERP, which indicates that you don't have enough decent content around the web that Google deems valuable and relevant for your audience. Jason notes that Google has changed its algorithm, and we now expect to see Rich Elements such as video boxes, Knowledge Panels, Twitter boxes, entity boxes, and People Also Ask, so if you're not seeing these elements, you may be in trouble.

The second sign that your Brand SERP is in trouble is if you're not answering the questions that your audience is asking. Jason believes that People Also Ask is often overlooked, but it's becoming increasingly common in SERPs, with 40% of Brand SERPs featuring it. He suggests that brands should answer the questions that appear in People Also Ask as this gives them an excellent opportunity to discover the content their audience is asking Google and that Google associates with their brand. Only 10% of brands answer the questions on their own Brand SERP in People Also Ask, which means they're missing out on a valuable opportunity to connect with their audience.

To address this issue, Jason recommends that you look at the questions that appear in People Also Ask, answer the first question, and then click on the rest to reveal more questions. By answering these questions, you can create valuable content that your audience is actively searching for, and this can help Google to favorably rank your site when considering SERP ranking. Answering these questions is an excellent way to engage with your audience, increase your brand's visibility, and boost your SERP ranking.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) provides some key indicators to detect if your Brand SERP is hitting rough waters. The initial symptom, as per his insights, is a Brand SERP displaying exclusively 10 blue links which elucidates a lack of substantial, quality content across the web that Google would consider beneficial or pertinent to your audience. Considering Google's updated algorithm, we now anticipate observing Rich Elements such as video boxes, Knowledge Panels, Twitter boxes, entity boxes, and People Also Ask, so their absence insinuates potential trouble. Another sign of a troubled Brand SERP is failing to answer questions being posed by your audience. He suggests that the 'People Also Ask' section, though often disregarded, is gaining prevalence in SERPs, with its presence in 40% of Brand SERPs. He encourages brands to tackle the questions appearing in this section as it extends a brilliant opportunity to uncover the kind of content that their audience is seeking from Google and is associated with their brand. Unfortunately, only 10% of brands address the questions enlisted in the ?People Also Ask? section of their own Brand SERP, thereby forsaking an indispensable opportunity for audience interaction. To confront this challenge, he proposes scrutiny of the questions appearing in the 'People Also Ask' section, answering the initial question and exploring the remaining queries. By providing these answers, you generate useful content that your audience is proactively searching, earning Google's approval and possibly a higher SERP ranking. Engaging in this manner greatly enhances audience interaction, strengthens your brand's visibility, and assists in enhancing your SERP ranking.",2,17,2023-02-16 09:29:16

You can then apply different techniques learned in his Brand SERP courses to improve these aspects. The next step is to consider which Rich Elements are relevant to your audience that you don't currently have. For example, if your Twitter account ranks well but you don't have Twitter Boxes, it suggests that your Twitter strategy needs improvement. To make your brand SERP look more attractive, you can work on your Twitter account by making it more relevant, engaging your audience, and pushing the account further to obtain Twitter Boxes.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) recommends that the initial step towards ameliorating your brand SERP is recognizing the elements that are within your control, partially under your control or beyond your control. Then, you can leverage various skills acquired from his Brand SERP courses to refine these elements. Subsequently, the focus should be on relevant Rich Elements that your audience values but have not been incorporated yet. For instance, if your Twitter profile is high-ranking but devoid of Twitter Boxes, it suggests a needed upgrade in your Twitter approach. To amplify the appeal of your brand SERP, you can enhance your Twitter engagement by increasing its relevance, captivating your audience, and pushing the profile to secure Twitter Boxes.",2,17,2023-02-15 14:02:01

Unlike brands, which tend to be less ambiguous, personal names can create confusion when multiple people share the same name. To address this issue, Jason suggests associating your name with another word that represents your job or using your middle initial to reduce ambiguity. He is currently working on an online course on how to manage personal Brand SERPs, and is collaborating with experts from Australia, Mary Henderson and Kate Dunne, to explore more techniques for personal branding.

In addition to using middle initials or associating names with job titles, Jason believes that personal branding can be improved by creating a unique space for oneself. He shares the example of a journalist from the Sunday Times, who started communicating with his middle initial all the time to establish a distinct online presence. However, Jason notes that this approach may not always work, as there may be other individuals or companies with similar names in the same industry. To overcome this, he suggests researching the competition and finding ways to differentiate oneself through branding.

Jason's upcoming course on managing personal Brand SERPs aims to provide individuals with tools and techniques for building a strong personal brand online.

Google uses this panel to display information and facts about a person or company, and it is located on the right-hand side of the desktop search results page. As human beings, we trust Google and perceive the information presented in the Knowledge Panel to be factual. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the correct and accurate information is displayed about a brand or individual in the panel to maintain a positive brand image and improve SEO.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) suggests that the Knowledge Panel, sometimes referred to as the information panel, is a fundamental resource for managing a brand and improving SEO.

414,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/meta/,Rebranding From Facebook to Meta: The Brand SERP Perspective,"Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) looks at the Brand SERP for Meta, or should he say Facebook. What Jason wanted to show today is how quickly Google has adapted, but also that Meta, Facebook, has actually helped them a lot in their preparation.

We have top stories, they're ""trending"", Google obviously pushes them to the top because they're very popular, there's a lot of news about them. The People Also Ask section hasn't caught up yet. The dictionary is still there. But then Jason looks in further, we have Facebook. They created this page the moment Mark Zuckerberg announced it. Within an hour, there was this page, and it was ranking within a few hours. We have the Twitter account that switched over and Google noticed that and recognized that, ranked those Twitter boxes and then some videos and that's the company that they actually bought in 2017. They've been planning that for four or five years. Then we have some more news, the Wikipedia article that they updated. And then we have another definition and then they bought advertising just to make sure.

So Facebook is giving Google some money, which is very gratifying. And then on the right hand side, we immediately see Meta Advertising Company. Before, it was a technology company, a scientific research company. And that changed within a couple of days of the announcement that the Wikipedia page changed.

And the founders, all this information within three days. Google has managed to update the Knowledge Graph and the Knowledge Panel. And that's largely because Google got it quickly, but also because Facebook Meta prepared it with Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crunchbase, and many other sources that they updated incredibly quickly after that announcement.

What Jason finds surprising is that Google has already managed to update the People Also Search For to relevant tech companies. Previously, meta.org was a scientific research company. So Meta, Facebook, did a very good rebranding within a few hours, and within three days the SERP was already pretty full of their information, a total dominance or a pretty total dominance, which is amazing. And Google and its algorithms have responded incredibly to represent this name change of Facebook.","Jason Barnard (the Brand SERP Guy) took a closer look at Meta, the new name for Facebook, and found out how quickly Google has adapted to this change. He also shed light on Meta's proactive role in the process. Google's top stories quickly included the latest Meta updates, although the ""People Also Ask"" section lagged behind. Interestingly, Facebook left no stone unturned and had its own page on Google within hours of Mark Zuckerberg's announcement. Moreover, the seamless transfer of the Twitter account, the timely updating of the website and the well-placed ads reflect the subtle but effective influence of Meta. Similarly, the rapid shift from technology to advertising seen on the Knowledge Graph and Panel within days of the news is a testament to Google's agility combined with Meta's rapid updates on platforms such as Wikipedia, Wikidata and Crunchbase. Even more impressive is that Google has already adjusted the 'People Also Search For' category to include relevant technology companies, replacing Meta's previous affiliation with scientific research. Overall, this surprisingly quick adoption of the rebranding shows how Meta has restored its dominance in the SERPs.

By adding Schema Markup to the Entity Home and pointing to corroborative information, a brand can provide a clear and machine-readable description of its products or services. However, once the brand starts pointing to corroborative information on other websites such as LinkedIn or Crunchbase, it may encounter factual errors, out-of-date information, or unclear descriptions. To maintain consistency, it is important to correct and standardize this information across all sources.

Jason Barnard emphasizes that the more Google sees the same information about a brand or entity repeated on trusted sources around the web, the more confident it becomes that the information is true. This confidence is crucial in triggering the Knowledge Panel, a box that appears on the right side of the SERP that provides important information about the entity. Therefore, it is important for brands to ensure that their information is correct and consistent across all sources, which will increase the chances of triggering the Knowledge Panel and improving their online visibility.","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) underscores the first major step in managing a brand's search engine results page (SERP) as establishing an 'Entity Home.' This is a webpage or digital platform embodying the brand. The introduction of Schema Markup to the Entity Home and linking it to corroborative data lays out a machine-readable, clear depiction of its offerings. Notwithstanding, when the brand begins linking to corroborative data found on other websites like LinkedIn or Crunchbase, it may encounter factual discrepancies, outdated details, or vague descriptions. To uphold consistency, correcting and standardizing this data across all resources is essential. Barnard underscores that the more repetitively Google identifies consistent information about a brand or entity from dependable web sources, the stronger its conviction that the information is accurate. This faith is pivotal in triggering the Knowledge Panel, a box appearing on the right side of the SERP, offering significant data about the entity. Consequently, for brands to heighten probabilities of prompting the Knowledge Panel and enhancing their digital prominence, ensuring the data is accurate and standardized across all resources is crucial.",2,17,2023-02-17 06:24:34

For instance, in San Francisco, Jason's Knowledge Panel does not appear because there is a professor with the same name, and Google thinks people are searching for the professor, not him. Conversely, in South Africa, where there is a famous footballer with the same name, Jason still gets the Knowledge Panel because the information about the footballer is not factual, and the Knowledge Graph has no confidence in its understanding. The elements of understanding, confidence, and geolocation are closely related to probability, which is an essential concept for entity-based search.

The probability that a user is searching for a particular person or brand or entity is becoming increasingly important, according to Jason. Although currently mainly based on geolocation, he believes that it will extend to interest-based as well. Dawn Anderson frequently discusses the probabilistic element of the Knowledge Graph, which is why it is a crucial aspect to consider when dealing with entity-based search.","Jason Barnard (tThe Brand SERP Guy) emphasizes that geolocation significantly influences the content presented in the Knowledge Panel, often superseding the impact of search history. For instance, in San Francisco, a professor bearing the same name often outranks Jason in the Knowledge Panel, as Google assumes people are more likely searching for the professor. However, in South Africa, despite the presence of a renowned footballer sharing his name, Jason's Knowledge Panel often appears due to the lack of factual information around the footballer, resulting in minimal confidence from the Knowledge Graph. The interplay of understanding, confidence, and geolocation are tied strongly to the concept of probability, a critical facet of entity-based searches. Jason adopts the belief that the probability of a user searching a specific person, entity, or brand is an increasingly relevant determinant. At present, this probability is predominantly reliant on geolocation, though Jason envisages interest-based parameters playing a future role. Dawn Anderson often accentuates the probabilistic component of the Knowledge Graph, lending more weight to its importance in entity-based searches.",2,17,2023-02-16 13:45:59

Businesses often overlook this aspect, but it is important to remember that the online world is simply a representation of the real world. Converting offline interactions to online content can help inform Google about a brand's credibility and improve its search engine ranking. For instance, writing about conferences or meetings with notable individuals on a company's website can provide valuable information to Google and help establish the company's credibility. This two-way confirmation from both the company and the individual can significantly impress Google and ultimately benefit the company's online presence.","Jason Barnard advises that translating offline activities into online content is vital for signaling to Google a brand's credibility. Companies frequently neglect this aspect, despite the digital sphere merely reflecting the tangible world. Transmuting offline engagement into online content can assist in educating Google about a brand's authenticity, thereby enhancing its search engine positioning. For example, documenting conferences or encounters with significant personalities on a business's website can supply valuable insights to Google, strengthening the company's credibility.

It is where one lives online and can present a defragmented representation of oneself to Google. Google is trying to understand who people are, what they do, and who their audience is by gathering fragmented information around the web. By having an Entity Home or a point of reconciliation, people can control how they are presented to their audience and how Google understands them.

For individuals, having an Entity Home is especially important for controlling their digital ecosystem. It is the only way to have some level of control over how they are presented to the world. With an Entity Home, people can present themselves to Google and have their fragmented pieces reconciled to form a complete representation of who they are. This way, Google can present them to their audience in the best possible way. Therefore, it is important for everyone to have an Entity Home that they control, as it is their only hope of controlling their digital ecosystem.","Jason Barnard advocates for the establishment of an ""Entity Home"" or ""point of reconciliation"" as a crucial component in managing one's digital landscape. The Entity Home serves as one's virtual residence where one can provide a consolidated digital representation to Google. Google primarily obtains a comprehension of individuals and brands by assembling scattered online information. Possessing an Entity Home enables one to regulate how they are depicted to their audience and how Google interprets their persona. Particularly for individuals, securing an Entity Home is a crucial measure for sustaining control over their online representation. It is the only feasible method to influence how they are portrayed globally. An Entity Home allows individuals to deliver a comprehensive account of who they are to Google, facilitating a reconciliation of varied fragments into a comprehensive profile. This ensures Google's depiction of them to their audience is as ideal as possible. Hence, maintaining an Entity Home controlled by the individual is imperative for anyone seeking to manage their online image effectively.",2,17,2023-02-23 06:29:59

To help with this, Jason has created a SaaS platform that provides information on the sources Google is looking at and advises on how to educate Google on which sources to use. The platform also tracks mentions, which he claims it does better than other mention trackers, and can be useful in building confidence in how Google presents your brand.

Jason stresses the importance of dominating your own Brand SERP, especially if you have an ambiguous name like his. To do this, he suggests building confidence in how Google presents your brand by providing multimedia content such as articles, videos, and social media presence. Google is a multimedia machine, so feeding it multimedia content can help ensure that your brand appears in various types of search result boxes, including video, author, and Twitter Boxes.

Jason points out that building a SaaS platform can have unexpected benefits, such as his platform's ability to track mentions better than other mention trackers. He encourages being open and honest with oneself when building such tools, as it may lead to unexpected results that can be beneficial.","Jason Barnard advocates for the establishment of an alert mechanism to monitor what materializes when your brand name is Googled. In this regard, Jason designed a SaaS platform that informs users about the references Google relies upon and provides guidance on instructing Google to utilize certain sources. This platform also has the capability to track mentions, which according to Jason, it executes more effectively than comparable mention trackers ? a feature valuable for instilling trust in Google's portrayals of your brand. Jason signifies the substantiality of securing dominance over your own Brand SERP, more so if you possess a common name like his own. He proposes a method to enhance confidence in Google's presentation of your brand through the supply of diverse multimedia content such as articles, videos, and a strong social media footprint. Given that Google operates as a multimedia engine, presenting it with multimedia content can help secure your brand's presence across various search result categories, encompassing video, author, and Twitter boxes. Jason notes that constructing a SaaS platform can reap unforeseen rewards, akin to his own platform's superior ability to track mentions compared to other mention trackers. He recommends maintaining a candid and self-aware approach in developing such tools, as this could lead to unexpected yet fruitful outcomes.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:07:54

He notes that Google is a user like everyone else and wants to quickly find the solution to a problem. Therefore, it's essential to present content in a way that Google can easily digest, comprehend and suggest as a solution when it's appropriate for its users.

He believes that the process of optimizing content for Google is straightforward. As a marketer, you need to take the solution that you have presented for the user and repackage it so that Google fully understands it and perceives it as the most efficient solution. In essence, it's not about changing your content strategy but rather about presenting it in a way that Google can quickly consume and understand. By doing this, you can convince Google that your solution is the best and most efficient for its users.","Jason Barnard advocates for the prioritizing of content presentation from Google's perspective. He highlights Google as another user who seeks quick and relevant solutions to problems. Thus, it's crucial to configure content so that Google can seamlessly digest, comprehend, and subsequently recommend it as a viable solution to its users. Jason asserts that refining content for Google should be a straightforward practice. Marketers need to repurpose their user-directed solutions in a manner that ensures Google can both absorb and understand it in a seamless manner, thus recognizing it as the most efficient solution. Essentially, the proposition isn't about redefining your content strategy, but rather tailoring it to allow for speedy consumption and comprehension by Google. This act of tailored presentation can sway Google into viewing and suggesting your solution as the most effective and efficient for its users.",2,17,2023-02-28 08:35:01

This can be an alternative to using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to connect to Google through a specific location, which can be slow and expensive. The GS Locator plugin, which Jason learned about from Andy Simpson, is a Chrome extension that lets users set their location to anywhere in the world with a high degree of accuracy.

By faking their location, users can see how their search results appear in different regions and adjust their branding strategies accordingly. This is especially useful for individuals or businesses with a global audience or those looking to expand their reach into new regions. The GS Locator plugin is designed specifically for Google search results and can be a valuable tool for anyone looking to improve their search rankings and visibility in different geographic locations.","Jason Barnard advocates for the use of a plugin called GS Locator. This software permits users to simulate their location on Google, serving the same function as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) but without incurring the high costs and reduced speed often associated with VPNs. The GS Locator plugin was recommended to Jason by Andy Simpson, and operates as a Chrome extension. It empowers users to manipulate their location down to the most precise detail, enabling them to observe how their search results may differ across varying locations and consequently refine their brand strategies. This tool is particularly beneficial for businesses or individuals who operate internationally or possess the ambition to penetrate new markets. Created solely for Google search results, the GS Locator plugin can significantly assist in enhancing visibility and rankings across diverse geographic locations.",2,17,2023-03-24 17:31:08

He mentioned that Danny Goodwin from Search Engine Journal updated his content for six months, while Semrush updated some of his articles to make them more relevant today. Jason believes that updating content is crucial because he has learned so much in the last three years that he can add to his new learning, making the content more valuable. He pointed out that updating content can lead to better rankings and increased traffic from Google.

Jason emphasized that content should be seen by Google as a solution to a specific problem or answer to a particular question to be considered relevant. Google aims to answer its users' questions or solve their problems, and the content should provide credible solutions or answers to satisfy Google's algorithm. Thus, updating content should also include making it relevant to the searchers' queries and providing valuable information that meets their needs.","Jason Barnard advocates updating content regularly to maintain its relevance to evolving trends and technological advances. As examples, he cites Danny Goodwin of Search Engine Journal, which has updated its content over six months, and Semrush, which has revised some articles to increase their relevance. Barnard believes that updating content is crucial as it allows for the inclusion of new insights gained over time, thus increasing the value of the content. He points out that optimizing outdated content can lead to better Google rankings and more organic traffic. Jason highlights the perception of content from Google's point of view - it should serve as a solution to a specific problem or an answer to a specific query in order to be considered relevant. Since Google's main goal is to respond to user queries and provide solutions, content should ideally be a credible source of answers or solutions to problems. Therefore, improving the relevance and value of content that answers users' search queries is an important part of content updates that ultimately lead to more Google traffic.",2,17,2023-04-04 17:52:28

Google is looking over your shoulder all the time. So whatever you do online, it'll leave a footprint. Google will find it. Google is the machine that finds everything. And it's a child. It looks at what you produce, and it'll believe in what you produce, as long as what you produce is relevant and helpful to your audience.

And the most important ones are your own website, number one. Your social media, number two: Twitter, Facebook, TikTok. The platform depends on where your audience is. So you should focus on the platforms where your audience hangs out. YouTube is usually a very good choice. And then the images you post there: Google shows images. You really have to be careful about that. Google picks and chooses from all this content on the Internet and presents your audience with the content they find helpful and valuable, right where they want to engage with you.

Jason Barnard gives a very quick example, his own name, Jason Barnard. If you search him, his website, Twitter, LinkedIn, his company, the videos on YouTube. And what you see there is Google saying, where would you like to connect with Jason Barnard? As a human being, as a regular person on his website, on Twitter because he likes Twitter, on LinkedIn because he hangs out on LinkedIn, on his company, or on YouTube. You have a choice of where you want to connect with him. It's a great Google business card because it gives you, Jason's audience, the ability to connect with him  in the way that you want.","Jason Barnard aims to underscore the inescapability of Google's presence. Google is akin to a watchful guardian, always tuned into your online activities and leaving traces of your actions. Being the pervasive machine it is, Google will uncover all the online breadcrumbs you leave behind. However, it operates like a child, believing and reflecting what you produce, as long as it's relevant and useful to your audience. The most crucial aspects here are your personal website and your presence on social media- whether it's Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok, depending heavily on where your audience primarily interacts. YouTube frequently proves to be a beneficial platform. Furthermore, the images you post also matter a great deal as Google also displays these. Google sifts through the vast expanse of online content, picking pieces that it deems to be valuable and useful to your audience. He uses himself as an example: A search for ""Jason Barnard"" reveals his website, Twitter, LinkedIn, company page, and YouTube videos. This reflects Google's way of asking users how they prefer to connect with Jason: through his personal life, via his website, Twitter, LinkedIn, his company, or YouTube. It serves as an effective 'Google business card,' allowing you, his audience, to engage with him in the manner you most prefer.",2,17,2023-02-23 04:58:11

However, when Google detects this cheating attempt, it deletes the panel as spam, teaching the machine not to be fooled. Jason warns that this practice is not only a waste of money but can also harm the credibility of the brand associated with it.

Jason explains that building a Knowledge Panel takes time as the machine needs to sort through vast amounts of data and connect the dots. He has developed a self-service platform called Kalicube Pro that guides users through the three-step process of creating a Knowledge Panel, including writing a clear description with Schema Markup and pointing to corroborative sources. While he acknowledges that this is boring work, he emphasizes that identifying the weaknesses and correcting them in the right order is essential.

In a somewhat bizarre shift in topic, Jason then makes a comment about how we have gone from educating children to punching people in the face. It is unclear what his point is, but it seems to suggest a societal decline or shift in values.","Jason Barnard alerts against the deceptive practice of paying $250 to set up a page on Wikitia, an inferior replica of Wikipedia, with the intent to activate a Knowledge Panel. He warns that Google, upon discovering such manipulation, will not hesitate to classify the panel as spam and eliminate it, thereby teaching the algorithm not to be fooled by such schemes. Jason cautions that this practice doesn't just squander money but may also tarnish the reputation of the linked brand. According to him, constructing a Knowledge Panel is a slow process as the algorithm must sift through enormous amounts of data and establish connections. Jason has conceived a self-service platform named Kalicube Pro that assists users in navigating the three-step process of creating a Knowledge Panel. This process includes crafting a lucid description with Schema Markup and directing to corroborating sources. While he admits the process can be mundane, he emphasizes the necessity of pinpointing the weak points and rectifying them in sequence. In a seemingly off-topic divergance, Jason remarks about how society has transitioned from nurturing children to adopting aggressive tactics, which, although ambiguous, seems to allude to a societal shift in principles or potential decline in values.",2,17,2023-03-23 10:02:31
611,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/person/nora-roberts/,Why Can?t Google Give Nora Roberts a Description Snippet for Her Homepage?,"Jason Barnard discusses the Brand SERP for Nora Roberts, an American author. He focuses on her website, Noraroberts.com, which Google has placed at the top of the left-hand side. However, no information is available for the page, and the title only contains her name. It is revealed that Nora Roberts has disallowed Google from viewing the site's content, leaving Google with no other option but to show her name as the Blue Link. This mistake with disallow occurs quite often, and it is surprising that Google is keeping her site at the top despite the problem. It might not do so for very much longer, warns Jason.

Nora Roberts' website is a great site for her fans to find out about her books and explore more about her, and even shop. However, Roberts has made the mistake of disallowing Google from visiting the site, which leaves her fans and audience without any real message at all. Jason emphasizes that one small error in one small part of a site is disallowing Google from visiting the site, let alone indexing it, and this mistake should not be taken lightly as it can affect the site's ranking on Google's search results.","Jason Barnard analyses the Brand SERP for Nora Roberts, a renowned American writer, with a focus on her website, Noraroberts.com. This website sits at the top of the left-hand side in Google's search results, despite not having any page information, and the title only includes the author's name. This arises due to Nora Roberts preventing Google from accessing the site's content, which results in Google displaying her name as the Blue Link by default. This occurrence of disallow is frequent and somewhat perplexing, considering that Google maintains her website at the top position regardless of the issue. Jason advises that this might not last much longer. Fans of Nora Roberts visit her website to learn about her literary works, delve deep into her universe, and even make purchases. But, Roberts' decision to disallow Google's access has deprived her followers and audience of any substantial message. Jason underscores the severity of such an error - a blunder in a single section of a website, like a disallow directive, can restrict Google from browsing the site, much less indexing it. This error is not to be overlooked as it can notably impact the website's position in Google's search results.",2,17,2023-03-20 13:29:18

On the right-hand side, he notices a Knowledge Panel that King could claim as his own.

Jason explains how to claim a Knowledge Panel, and notes that King's Twitter account and website are correctly linked, but he expresses concern about a Facebook page about one of King's books that appears to be claiming the Knowledge Panel. He notes that the publisher, Penguin Random House, could be responsible for this, and while he doesn't know if this is a mistake on Google's part, he emphasizes that he would not be comfortable with a commercial company claiming his Knowledge Panel because it is personal.","Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP for renowned American author Stephen King. In the left portion of the search results page, he spotlights the standard information expected for a famous author, including references to Twitter, Wikipedia, and Top Stories.

He acknowledges that King's Twitter handle and website are appropriately linked. However, he expresses discomfort concerning a Facebook page related to one of King's books seemingly laying claim to the Knowledge Panel.

He notes that the SERP is full of ads, with Cetaphil's UK site ranking at the top. There are also several People Also Ask boxes and a significant number of products at superdrug.com. The SERP is heavily visual, with many product images.

Jason observes that, despite the presence of a Wikipedia page for Cetaphil, there is no Knowledge Panel displayed on the right-hand side of the SERP. He cautions against relying solely on Wikipedia for obtaining a Knowledge Panel. Although Wikipedia can be helpful in providing Google with a greater understanding of a brand, having a Wikipedia page does not guarantee the display of a Knowledge Panel on a Brand SERP. Cetaphil's Wikipedia page has been around for six years, but the brand still does not have a Knowledge Panel on Google. This serves as a lesson to not rely entirely on Wikipedia for obtaining a Knowledge Panel.","Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP of Cetaphil, a company specializing in skincare products. He comments on the predominance of ads in the SERP, with Cetaphil's UK website achieving top ranking. Several People Also Ask boxes and an abundance of products at superdrug.com also feature prominently. With a high visibility of product images, the SERP is highly visual. Despiting Cetaphil having an existent Wikipedia page, Jason points out the absence of a Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side of the SERP. He suggests not to depend exclusively on Wikipedia for securing a Knowledge Panel. Although having a Wikipedia page may assist Google in gaining a fuller comprehension of a brand, a Knowledge Panel on a Brand SERP is not automatically guaranteed. Even though Cetaphil's Wikipedia page has been on the web for six years, Google's Knowledge Panel for the brand remains unseen.

The SERP features their ads at the top, along with their website, sitelinks, a knowledge panel on the right-hand side, and Twitter boxes, making it a very rich SERP. However, Jason also noticed a gallery of images under the blue link, which he finds interesting as it demonstrates Google's willingness to go the extra mile to add visuals to SERPs to improve user experience.

Although Jason believes that the image gallery is likely an experiment, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring Brand SERPs and keeping an eye on experiments that Google may be conducting. By doing so, businesses can stay ahead of the competition and be prepared for any changes that may be introduced to the SERP. Overall, the Brand SERP for The North Face showcases the potential for SERPs to become even richer in content, and highlights the value of being aware of Google's experiments and changes.","Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP of The North Face, a renowned apparel firm. The SERP prominently exhibits their ads, website, sitelinks, a knowledge panel on the right, and Twitter feeds, yielding a content-rich SERP. Intriguingly, Jason also spots an image gallery beneath the blue link, a feature that manifests Google's commitment to enhancing SERPs with visual appeal for improved user interaction. While Jason conjectures this image gallery could be an exploratory endeavor, it underscores the significance of vigilantly monitoring Brand SERPs and keeping abreast of Google's possible experimentation. By doing so, companies can gain a competitive edge and readiness for any alterations that may be implemented in the SERP.

He points out several interesting features, such as an image gallery that is being displayed in a blue link. This is a new feature that he has not seen before, and it's an example of Google's more advanced and exciting testing. Additionally, there are rich sitelinks under the Wikipedia page in the middle of the SERP, which is also a new and experimental feature. These features demonstrate that Google is prioritizing visually vivid and animated pages.

Jason notes that these new features are not related to the structure of a website, but rather the organization of the page itself. He suggests that businesses start structuring their pages to potentially trigger these rich sitelinks. This kind of experiment is not going away and will become more prevalent in the future. Jason believes that this feature will be more present in the future than it is today, so businesses should start preparing now to take advantage of it when it rolls out worldwide.

In conclusion, Jason's analysis of the Crocs Brand SERP highlights the importance of keeping up with Google's experimentation and innovation in order to stay ahead of the competition. The new features being tested, such as the image gallery and rich sitelinks, demonstrate that Google is placing an emphasis on visually appealing and organized pages. By paying attention to these developments and proactively structuring their pages, businesses can position themselves to take advantage of these new features when they become more prevalent in the future.","Jason Barnard analyzes the Crocs Brand SERP, highlighting several intriguing attributes. Among these is a blue link displaying an image gallery, a feature he considers new and innovative. Also noteworthy are the rich sitelinks nestled beneath the Wikipedia page on the SERP ? an experimental advancement from Google. The introduction of visually striking and dynamic web pages seems to be Google's focus. Jason goes on to point out that these features are determined not by site structure, but by the page organization. Therefore, he advises businesses to begin arranging their pages in a way that could potentially set off these rich sitelinks. He believes that this trend will gain more traction in the future, advising firms to get ready to adopt this innovation when it becomes globally available. Summarily, Jason's evaluation of Crocs Brand SERP underscores the importance of staying updated with Google's experimental and evolving features to stay competitive. The emerging features like the image gallery and rich sitelinks suggest Google's emphasis on visual appeal and page organization. Businesses, by being proactive and structuring their pages effectively, are poised to leverage these innovations when they become more widespread in the future.",2,17,2023-02-20 13:38:43
868,Transcript,,Google's Future Language Models and the Importance of Human Involvement in Training Them,"According to Jason Barnard, Google will soon launch new Learning Language Models (LLMs) that will result in significant fluctuations in core algorithm updates. The reason behind this is that people are now using ChatGPT to generate millions of texts, and Google's current language models are getting tricked. However, Google has the resources and technology to build better LLMs that can update every time people try to cheat it, and these updates will result in significant fluctuations in core algorithm updates. Therefore, those who have relied too much on AI technology will be slammed and lose their position.

Jason emphasizes the importance of keeping humans in the loop and training their own models alongside AI technology to avoid being penalized by Google's upcoming updates. The machine will spit out text, which humans will improve and feed back to the machine, resulting in an improvement in the machine's capabilities. However, he also warns that it's easy to criticize existing text but much harder to write the initial text.","Jason Barnard anticipates that Google will introduce advanced Learning Language Models (LLMs) that will lead to noticeable shifts in core algorithm updates. This development is due to the influx of texts generated via ChatGPT, which appear to be confusing Google's existing language models. Nonetheless, Google has the capacity and technological prowess to construct superior LLMs that are updated with each manipulation, resulting in significant fluctuations in core algorithm updates.

As a result, those who have relied too heavily on AI technology could face severe penalties and loss of reputation. Jason highlights the need for human engagement in conjunction with the use of AI technology in training their models as a strategy to avoid penalties in the wake of Google's upcoming updates.

In this model, the machine generates text that is improved by humans and fed back into the machine, resulting in improved machine performance. However, Jason also urges caution: while it is quite easy to critique existing text, creating the original text is much more challenging.",2,17,2023-03-31 20:05:13

He suggests that by creating new content with relevance to old content, you can bring in more viewers and add additional value to the user. To succeed in this ecosystem, you need to continually nourish and add to it.

873,Transcript,,Why Focusing on Information Gap is More Important than Search Demand for SEO Optimization,"According to Jason Barnard, when creating content, it is important to focus on filling the information gap rather than just meeting search demand or answering a query. He explains that an information gap can still exist even if others have answered a particular question within the industry. The focus should be on answering that question within your own site.

Jason gives an example of an article he recently published on optimizing for SEO in SERP. He notes that many others have written about optimizing for SERP features, so there is competition. However, by focusing on filling the information gap within his own site, he was able to quickly rank on page two without any external links, which he considers a great achievement.","Jason Barnard argues that the cornerstone of content creation is to fill the information gap, rather than just fulfilling search queries or responding to an SEO optimization request. He explains that an information gap can exist even if a question has already been answered by other professionals. He suggests focusing on answering this question on your website. To illustrate this, Barnard cites an article he wrote about optimizing SERP SEO.

He notes that people often search for someone's name before interacting with them, and having a book published can greatly enhance one's personal brand.

Furthermore, Jason discusses the importance of having a unique name for personal branding purposes, as it makes it easier for Google to understand and differentiate between individuals. He uses the example of his own name, which he shares with a UK-based podcaster, and notes that despite not being the most relevant result, he still comes up first in Google searches due to Google's understanding of his online presence.","Jason Barnard articulated the role of personal branding and Google's interpretation of an individual's online persona in establishing their reliability and trustworthiness. He highlighted the common practice of individuals Googling someone's name prior to initiating contact, and illustrated how publishing a book can significantly aid in fortifying one's personal brand. Jason also underscored the significance of a distinctive name in the realm of personal branding since it facilitates Google's comprehension and discrimination amongst individuals.

He emphasized the need to focus on your audience and where they hang out, such as social channels, forums, and third-party sites, rather than creating content solely for Google. By creating valuable content on these platforms that is useful for your audience in the context of that platform, you can then repurpose it for your own website and package it for Google.

Additionally, Jason shared his experience with content strategy and advised marketers to think about where their audience is and what they are talking about, and create content accordingly. He mentioned platforms such as LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, and YouTube, as well as third-party sites like Search Engine Journal, where he creates content for his audience. The goal is to create content that is useful and valuable to your audience, and then package it for Google as a bonus.","Jason Barnard articulated the significance of weaving a narrative around one's brand. This process involves generating content that aligns with user needs instead of merely subduing negative Brand SERP results. He stressed the importance of audience-focused strategies and encouraged developing content for the platforms frequented by the audience such as social media, forums, and third-party sites, rather viewing Google as the sole objective. The value addition provided by this content to audience members serves as the fundamental objective, post which the content can be reformatted for the website and tailor-fitted for Google. Jason communicated his content strategy insights and urged marketeers to focus on their audience's locations and discussions, subsequently creating relevant content. He highlighted platforms including LinkedIn, Medium, Quora, and YouTube, alongside third-party sites like Search Engine Journal, as effective spaces for audience-centered content creation.

It is the answer that Google provides to the user's query. However, Jason warns that this top spot is constantly evolving, and it is likely that Google will continue to change the layout of its search results page. He also points out that Position 0 is more extensive than many people realize, and businesses can obtain a portion of this real estate by including an image in their content.

In addition, Jason notes that related answers provide a great opportunity for businesses to rank for queries that they would not typically rank for. He cites a study by Semrush in France that found that 60% of related answers do not rank for the original question they answer in the search results. This may be because the answer is given within the context of the first question. Therefore, providing related answers could be a valuable strategy for businesses to rank for more queries and obtain a portion of the coveted Position 0 real estate.","Jason Barnard articulates that Position 0, otherwise known as the featured snippet, is the coveted top rank on Google's search outcomes, delivering the answer to a user's search query.

He also accentuates that the scope of Position 0 is broader than commonly perceived. Companies can acquire a share of this space by integrating images into their content. Jason additionally underscores that related answers provide a lucrative chance for businesses to rank for searches they wouldn't typically rank for. Citing a Semrush study in France, he reveals that 60% of related answers don't rank for the original question they respond to in search results, possibly due to the context of the first question.

When presented with a term like ""yellow door,"" it is unclear whether the user is referring to a physical yellow door, a caf, or a toy manufacturer. Google attempts to solve this problem by presenting a Search Engine Results Page (SERP) that offers users different options to choose from. However, this ambiguity will never be completely eradicated, as it is a fundamental problem for both humans and Google.

The first step in reducing ambiguity is to step back and assess whether the term is unclear. If it is, then efforts can be made to clarify it. By making it less ambiguous for humans, it will also become less ambiguous for Google. Ultimately, this will benefit businesses from both a human and Google perspective.","Jason Barnard asserts that ambiguity can pose a substantial challenge for both people and Google. Where a term like ""yellow door"" could be referring to an actual yellow door, a caf, or a toy company, for example. Google tries to mitigate this issue by delivering diverse options on a Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Although, complete eradication of such ambiguities might be unattainable as it's a fundamental challenge for both human beings and Google alike. The initial step toward minimizing ambiguity is to consider whether a term is imprecise. If it appears to be, it's necessary to strive towards refining it. Making it less ambiguous for human interpretation will concurrently make it less ambiguous for Google.

By looking at the Brand SERP, Knowledge Panel, People Also Ask section, and Entity Boxes, it's possible to see the associations that Google is making between different topics and entities. For businesses, it's important to understand the Filter Pills that are currently being used in the US, which allow users to filter search results by specific categories such as education, songs, and videos. In the future, these Filter Pills could be used for companies, with categories such as products, key people, and CEO/founder. It's important for businesses to master these multiple vertical Brand SERPs in order to present themselves in the best light to their audience.

Jason stated that Google is a trusted source of information, and if businesses want to be presented in their best light, they need to explain to Google what that best light looks like.

The audience, in this case, is a subset of Google's users who are specifically searching for you or something related to you. Google aims to represent you honestly in its search results.

To improve your Brand SERP, Jason suggests that the first step is to look at your Homepage. The Homepage of a company's website or a personal website is most likely what will rank first in Google's search results. If it does not represent you properly, you can change the meta title and meta description using tools such as WordPress and Yoast. You can also modify the content that appears on the page to ensure that it is more representative of you. The next step is to optimize other pages such as About Us, Contact Us, and Blog Landing Pages, which will appear as Sitelinks underneath the main result.","Jason Barnard clarifies that a Brand SERP is the set of search results that Google displays when one searches for your personal or brand name, or anything affiliated with you.

Artificial intelligence implies that machines can replace humans in thinking and decision-making, while machine learning focuses on improving the efficiency of a specific task. Rather than taking control, the machine is simply given instructions and asked to complete the task more effectively and efficiently than humans.

Jason argues that machine learning is less scary because it does not involve machines taking over, but rather working alongside humans to improve outcomes. Machines are able to process information and perform tasks in real-time, making them more efficient than humans. Therefore, using machine learning to complete tasks allows humans to work smarter, not harder. Overall, the use of machine learning can serve humans well by improving efficiency and effectiveness.","Jason Barnard clarifies the important difference between artificial intelligence and machine learning. Artificial intelligence suggests that machines could replace human thought processes and decision-making capabilities, whereas machine learning focuses on enhancing the efficiency of a particular task. Instead of taking charge, machines are given directives and asked to fulfill the task more proficiently and effectively than humans can. Jason contends that machine learning is less intimidating as it doesn't involve machines seizing control, but rather collaborating with humans to better outcomes. Machines can operate in real-time, making them superior to humans in terms of efficiency. Hence, employing machine learning for task completion enables humans to function more intelligently rather than exerting more effort.

He notes that while these Boxes usually display tweets from the person or company's Twitter profile, in this case, they contain a collection of tweets about Jennifer Lawrence, likely because she doesn't have an active Twitter account. Jason points out that the Twitter Boxes now show who posted the tweets and that they update in real-time, sometimes even more frequently than owned Twitter channels that feed into Brand SERPs.

Just like a child needs clear explanations and corroboration from different sources to believe something, Google needs to be educated about a website's content and purpose. SEO involves educating Google about a website's corner of the internet, what it offers users, why it might be the best solution, and how it can be displayed in the SERP. In essence, SEO is packaging content for Google and educating it about what a website offers, to whom, and why it might be the best solution.

Jason suggests that instead of viewing Google as a big, scary machine, we should see it as a child that we need to educate. By creating authoritative content on a specific topic, a website can build itself up as an authority in that field, and Google will trust it more when it talks about that topic. The more a website can show itself as an expert on a particular topic, the more Google will trust it to help users with problems related to that topic.

Therefore, SEO involves educating Google and building trust with it by creating authoritative content. By doing so, a website can establish itself as a trustworthy solution for Google's users and improve its ranking in the SERP.","Jason Barnard compares SEO to child education. Similar to how a youngster requires clear explanations validated from multiple sources to trust something, Google needs to be tutored about a website's content and objective. SEO entails schooling Google about a site's specific niche in the digital world, its offerings to users, reasons for its potential superiority, and how it can be effectively displayed in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). Essentially, SEO is about packaging digital content for Google's understanding, communicating the website's offerings, the targeted audience, and reasons for its superiority. Instead of perceiving Google as an intimidating machine, Jason recommends envisioning it as a child awaiting education. By generating authoritative content on distinct topics, a website can cultivate its authority in that sphere, rendering it more trustworthy to Google when those topics are discussed. The greater a website can establish its expertise on a specific topic, the more likely Google is to trust it as a resource for user-related queries on that topic. Hence, SEO involves instructing Google and fostering confidence by creating potent content.

The first thing he notices is the lack of rich sitelinks at the top of the SERP, which could have helped users navigate directly to the relevant section of the website. He explains that the reason for this might be the lack of textual content on the website, making it difficult for Google to understand the role of each page and generate rich sitelinks.

Jason suggests that the website should focus on creating more text content that clearly describes the purpose of each page and what users can expect to find on it. This will not only help Google generate rich sitelinks but also improve the user experience by making it easier for them to find what they are looking for. By having more control over the top of the Brand SERP, Cars and Cloaks can attract more potential customers and increase their online visibility.

Although the website is visually appealing and logical for what they are selling, it lacks the necessary textual content that Google needs to understand the website's structure and generate rich sitelinks. Jason's analysis highlights the importance of having a balance between visual and textual content to improve the user experience and gain more control over the Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard conducted an analysis of the Brand SERP for Cars and Cloaks, a car wrapping service based in London, UK.

Jason points out that the reason for this is because the company hasn't tweeted since July 15th. Google removes Twitter boxes from Brand SERPs when there is no Twitter activity for a certain period of time.

This serves as a reminder that it's important to maintain social media activity if you want to keep your Twitter boxes on your Brand SERP.

Instead, he recommends organizing pages into silos or folders. One important silo is the About section, which should include pages about the company, products, team, and contact information. By organizing this section into a silo, Google will recognize that it's all serving the same purpose and may display it as Rich Sitelinks. Additionally, having a blog silo can also improve the chances of displaying Rich Sitelinks for blog articles based on freshness and perceived importance.","Jason Barnard counsels against a site structure where all pages rest at the root level. He proposes a silo or folder arrangement instead. A vital silo to consider is the About section, housing pages detailing the company, its products, team, and contact details. By structuring this segment into a silo, Google can identify its unified intent and possibly represent it as Rich Sitelinks. Furthermore, maintaining a blog silo could enhance the likelihood of presenting Rich Sitelinks for blog entries based on their recency and perceived significance.",2,17,2023-03-22 13:29:43

They see this as the magic solution to their business problems, assuming that once they rank high on Google, they will automatically sell more. However, Jason emphasizes that people often forget that effective online marketing involves multiple steps, and that at some point, potential customers will search for a specific brand name. This is the moment when businesses can convince potential customers to do business with them. Therefore, Jason stresses the importance of a Brand SERP for a brand's name. He refers to it as a Google Business Card, and argues that if it looks great, Google is essentially recommending the brand.

In summary, while ranking high on Google for specific keywords is important, it is equally crucial for businesses to focus on their Brand SERP, as this is often the first impression potential customers will have of their brand. Jason argues that a positive Brand SERP is essentially a recommendation from Google, and can greatly influence a customer's decision to do business with a brand.","Jason Barnard criticizes the single-minded focus on keyword rankings prevalent in the SEO field. He observes that many view high Google rankings as the ultimate panacea for their business woes, assuming it guarantees higher sales. Jason underscores that a successful online marketing strategy involves several steps, one of which includes potential customers searching for a specific brand name. This is a pivotal moment when businesses can sway potential clients. According to Jason, the importance of a brand's Brand SERP, which he dubs as a Google Business Card, cannot be overstated. If it's appealing, it acts as an endorsement from Google itself. Thus, while it's vital to rank high on Google for certain keywords, equal attention should be given to a business's Brand SERP because it often forms the preliminary impression a potential customer has of a brand. Being projected positively through a Brand SERP is akin to getting a thumbs up from Google, significantly impacting a customer's decision to engage with the brand.",2,17,2023-02-28 02:31:19

While the Kalicube Pro platform provides this service, it is not covered in the beginner book. Additionally, Kalicube Pro offers courses for intermediate users who already know enough about SEO to be dangerous and want to stay on track.

Jason emphasizes the importance of managing the message that Google is sending out to your audience through your brand SERP. He notes that everyone will eventually see it, so it is essential to pay attention. Rich Sitelinks are an indicator that Google considers your site's content to be helpful and important to your audience. If this is not the case, it is up to the site owner to re-educate Google by organizing their site structure and grouping pages by topic and theme.","Jason Barnard deems Schema Markup as a crucial ingredient in maintaining an accurate Brand SERP, though it might necessitate extra effort. Although this service is offered by Kalicube Pro, it is not incorporated in the starter book. For intermediate users who have a solid foundational understanding of SEO and seek guidance, Kalicube Pro provides relevant courses. Jason underlines the significance of controlling the information Google disseminates to your audience via your brand SERP, noting its inevitability of being seen by everyone, hence the urgency to monitor it. Rich Sitelinks are a sign of Google's assessment of your site's content as essential and helpful to your audience. If this does not align, it becomes the site owner's responsibility to guide Google in the right direction by arranging the site structure and grouping the pages according to topic and theme.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:20:39

Jason stated that his own Brand SERP has been stable since 2013, with his top results remaining consistent. However, since he started creating a lot of content, Google has been experimenting with his SERP. While the top of a Brand SERP will be the brand itself, the rest of the results may be volatile and change frequently. Once a Brand SERP is established, it will tend to be more stable.

Jason recommends creating content that will stabilize a brand's image in the beginning. Afterward, brands can create content in a focused manner to keep the image stable. However, brands that want to experiment can create lots of content in different places to see what happens. He is a fan of experimenting and encourages his followers to follow him on Twitter to see his experiments.

Overall, brands can benefit from creating lots of content, but should focus on creating content that will stabilize their brand image. Once a Brand SERP is established, it will tend to be more stable. However, brands that want to experiment can create lots of content in different places to see what happens.","Jason Barnard delved into the dynamic nature of Brand SERPs, revealing that his personal Brand SERP has remained steady since 2013 with the top results being constant. However, with the creation of volumes of content, Google has begun to perform experiments with his SERP. While the pinnacle of a Brand SERP will typically be the brand itself, the remaining results can fluctuate and frequently vary. Upon the establishment of a Brand SERP, it is likely to exhibit more stability. Initially, Jason advocates creating content that will solidify a brand's image. Subsequent to this, brands should create content selectively to maintain this image stability. Nonetheless, brands keen on experimentation can proliferate content across diverse platforms to observe what ensues. Being an enthusiast of experiments, Jason invites his followers to track his experiment results on Twitter. In sum, producing abundant content may be beneficial for brands, yet the focus should be on content that consolidates their brand image. Once a Brand SERP is firmly in place, it should generally demonstrate more stability. Despite this, brands with a propensity for experiments can produce copious amounts of content in varied locations to witness the outcome.",2,17,2023-03-23 17:59:54

He notes that Shulke's name is fairly unique and well-known to Google. However, the interesting thing is that when they published videos about Anton with his name in the title, they were able to get onto his Brand SERP within an hour. This demonstrates how quickly one can control the content that Google shows to their audience. It also highlights the importance of creating and optimizing video content to enhance one's personal Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard delves into an analysis of Anton Shulke's personal Brand SERP, with an emphasis on the videos segment.

Particularly intriguing is the fact that when they published videos about Anton, including his name in the title, the content found its way onto his Brand SERP in just an hour.

He discusses how he started experimenting with Google in 2013 when people were searching his name and finding results for a blue dog. He had to educate Google to replace the dog with his work as a digital marketer, which took a lot of effort. The dog still appears in the SERP, but is much less prominent.

Jason highlights that educating Google was not just about teaching the search engine about himself, but also about the blue dog so that it could differentiate between the two. He explains that now when someone searches for him, they see him as a small detail in the SERP with the dog, and when they search for the dog, they see the dog as a small detail in the SERP with him. Jason's experience demonstrates the importance of understanding how Google works and how to optimize your online presence in order to be recognized and found by potential clients.","Jason Barnard delves into his journey of experimenting and instructing Google to amplify his digital marketing persona in the online sphere. He recounts starting his experiment in 2013 when his name's search results often led to a 'blue dog'. Consequently, he invested considerable effort to tutor Google to show him as a digital marketer and not equate him with the blue dog. Despite the dog still being part of the search results, its prominence has significantly declined. Jason elucidates that the objective was not merely making Google understand his present role, but also distinguishing it from the blue dog's character. Therefore, when people look up his name now, the search results show the dog with a small reference to him, and vice versa when they search for the blue dog. Jason's story underscores the importance of comprehending Google's mechanism and the optimization of your online visibility for ensuring easy recognition and accessibility to potential clients.",2,17,2023-03-22 09:41:45

While Chefman has many different varieties of air fryers, Jason focuses on the company's Brand SERP and notes that the right-hand side shows See Results About With Reviews, which he finds strange because he expected a Knowledge Panel for the manufacturer. He goes on to explain that this is just a local business listing and suggests that this is not a great Brand SERP because Chefman does not have a dedicated website.

Jason suggests that RJ Brands, the parent company of Chefman, should create a corporate website to start dominating the Brand SERP for a search on the company name rather than just the product. He notes that this would be a good move for Chefman because it is a major product in the US, and having a dedicated website would make the Brand SERP more professional and effective.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for Chefman, a leading air fryer brand in the US. Despite the multiple air fryer variants that Chefman offers, Jason's analysis primarily targets the company's Brand SERP. He observes the appearance of 'See Results About With Reviews' on the right-hand side, which catches him off guard as he anticipated a Knowledge Panel for the manufacturer. He further elucidates that this is merely a local business listing and argues that this does not constitute an impressive Brand SERP due to Chefman's lack of a standalone website. Jason recommends that RJ Brands, Chefman's parent company, establish a corporate website to dominate the Brand SERP when users search for the company name, rather than just the products. He believes that considering Chefman's significant market presence in the US, having a dedicated website would enhance the professionalism and effectiveness of its Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-03-21 09:57:26

He explains that when people search for Investopedia, they're typically looking for articles on the site, and Google has made it easy for them to find relevant content by adding a Search Box directly on the SERP. Additionally, Google has added a feature that displays the latest articles from different topics on the site, making it easier for users to navigate and find content that interests them.

Jason notes that Google uses an algorithm to determine the credibility and quality of publishers, and displays this information in the Knowledge Panel. The addition of these features makes for a great user experience, as users can find what they're looking for without having to leave the Google SERP. Overall, the features added by Google to the Investopedia SERP provide a simple and useful navigational tool for users interested in investment markets, stocks, banks, and more.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for Investopedia.

Ask Les Wampas!,"Jason Barnard takes a look at the Brand SERP for Les Wampas, a French rock group he played music with in the 90s. He highlights the right-hand rail and how it shows how much information needs to be controlled. Google displays a lot of helpful information, such as the group's songs, albums, band members, events, social profiles, and more. Even though the focus is on entertainment, businesses can learn from this and see where they're going with their own right rail. Jason stresses the importance of businesses controlling as much of their information as possible.

The right-hand rail on the Brand SERP is becoming increasingly important for businesses. Just like Les Wampas, businesses need to control as much of their information as possible in the right rail. The rail includes a lot of helpful information about a business, and businesses need to make sure that this information is accurate and up-to-date. For example, a business can use the right rail to showcase their products, board members, upcoming events, and social profiles. Businesses can learn a lot from the right rail and should take steps to control as much of their information as possible to make the most out of this valuable space.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for Les Wampas, a French rock group he was part of in the nineties. He emphasizes the significance of the right rail, showing how it provides critical insights and information that must be carefully managed. Google displays a range of handy details such as the band's songs, albums, band members, events, and social profiles, among others. Though this focuses on an entertainment aspect, it serves as an important lesson for businesses to understand their future direction in managing their own right rail. Jason underlines the need for businesses to oversee as much of their publicly displayed information as they feasibly can. The right-hand rail on the Brand SERP is turning into an essential component for businesses. Similar to Les Wampas, businesses must take charge of as much of their information in the right rail.

Google Decides!","Jason Barnard examines the Brand SERP for Mike Matas. Jason notes that while he was not familiar with Matas, Google's presentation of his Brand SERP is accurate and informative, with social profiles ranking highly. However, there is some confusion regarding Matas' profession - while Wikipedia describes him as a user interface designer and icon artist, Matas' website refers to him as an entrepreneur. Google, on the other hand, describes him as an inventor.

Jason explains that in the past, Google would simply use the first description listed on Wikipedia, but it appears that the search engine is now more flexible and may create its own subtitles for Knowledge Graph entries. This highlights the importance of managing one's own Brand SERP, as Google may not always use the desired description or title.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for Mike Matas, and though Jason admits his unfamiliarity with Matas, he acknowledges Google's accurate and informative presentation on his Brand SERP, featuring highly ranked social profiles. However, there is apparent ambiguity surrounding Matas' career classification - Wikipedia portrays him as a user interface designer and icon artist, his personal website labels him an entrepreneur, while Google categorizes him as an inventor. Jason elucidates that traditionally, Google would adopt the initial description mentioned on Wikipedia, but it now seems to have adopted a more fluid approach, potentially creating its unique sub-headings for Knowledge Graph entries. This underlines the significance of proactively managing one's Brand SERP, as Google may not necessarily adopt the preferred description or nomenclature.",2,17,2023-03-20 13:20:52

He emphasizes the importance of understanding the People Also Ask section of Google search results, which is customized based on the user's search history and behavior. For example, if Jason clicks on a question about Planet Organic closing, the subsequent questions will focus on the company's situation in Canada. However, if he reloads the page and clicks on a generic question about UK supermarkets with the best organic range, the suggested questions will be different and focused on the benefits of organic food.

Jason explains that Google uses the People Also Ask section to guide users towards information that they may find useful or interesting, and companies need to understand how their audience perceives them and their industry. This understanding can help brands create targeted content that addresses the questions and concerns of their audience. By optimizing their Brand SERP and ensuring that the information presented accurately reflects their brand, companies can build a strong online reputation and increase their visibility to potential customers.

In conclusion, Jason's analysis highlights the importance of understanding the People Also Ask section of Google search results and how it can help companies tailor their content to meet the needs and interests of their audience. Brands that optimize their Brand SERP and provide useful and relevant information to users can build a positive online reputation and attract more customers to their business.","Jason Barnard delves into The Brand SERP for Planet Organic, a UK-based supermarket chain with a presence in London through eight outlets. He accentuates the significance of comprehending Google's People Also Ask section, which is tailored according to the user's search conduct and history. For Instance, if Jason selects a question related to Planet Organic going out of business, the following questions concentrate on the company's status in Canada. Conversely, if he refreshes the page and chooses a broad query about supermarkets with top organic options in the UK, appended questions shift to discussing the merits of organic food. Jason elaborates that Google employs the People Also Ask section to navigate users towards potentially helpful or intriguing facts. Hence, firms need to grasp how their audience perceives them and their sector. This knowledge can aid brands in producing focused content that addresses audience queries and concerns. Optimizing their Brand SERP and ensuring that the displayed data accurately characterizes their brand can enable companies to construct a solid online reputation and enhance their visibility to prospective customers. In a nutshell, Jason's scrutiny underscores the importance of understanding Google's People Also Ask section and how it can assist corporations in customizing their content to cater to their audience's necessities and interests.

He highlights The Rich Sitelinks and Knowledge Panel, but what caught his attention were the great reviews on Glassdoor. Q5 Partners has over four stars, which is uncommon as a good score on employee review platforms is typically three and a half. Jason notes that the people who leave reviews on such platforms are usually dissatisfied ex-employees. To counteract this, he advises companies to ask their current employees who are happy to leave a review. However, this can be challenging to navigate as it is difficult to ask one's employees to leave a positive review.

Overall, Jason suggests that companies keep employee review platforms off their Brand SERP as much as possible. Although great reviews can be beneficial, he warns that they can also be unusual and potentially raise questions about authenticity. It is important to note that companies can still use employee review platforms to gather feedback and improve their business practices.","Jason Barnard delves into The Brand SERP for Q5 Partners, emphasizing features like The Rich Sitelinks and Knowledge Panel.

The rest of the Brand SERP is fairly typical for a film, including trailers and clips, questions, and top stories.

However, what caught Jason's attention is the image carousel, which features a video rather than a still image for the film's trailer. This mixing of images and videos in the image carousel is unusual and may be something to look out for in the future for brand SERPs, particularly in the entertainment industry.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for the 2013 movie, The Croods.

In New York, Twitter Boxes appear on the left-hand side, and the cast, episodes, and characters are listed in the left-hand rail rather than the Knowledge Panel.

Jason believes that the SERP in New York offers a multimedia experience of information about and around Squid Game, which is useful for users. However, it also makes the work of Brand SERP optimization and Knowledge Panel management more challenging but also more exciting and interesting. He notes that the Filter Pills at the top and verticals, such as trailers and clips, are becoming increasingly important in Brand SERP management. Overall, the mixed results in the Squid Game Brand SERP demonstrate how Google is experimenting with the search results layout, making it necessary for brands to stay on top of their Brand SERP optimization.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP for the hit South Korean TV show, Squid Game. While the left-side of the search results features IMDB, People Also Ask, Videos, Top Stories, Bluelinks, and Related Searches, the right-side hosts the Knowledge Panel--spilling details about the cast, episodes, characters, reviews, and related searches. Nevertheless, he observes that Google seems to be juggling the results, especially in the US, where the boundary between the left and right rail is increasingly becoming indistinct. For example, in New York, Twitter Boxes are featured on the left side, and particulars about the cast, episodes, and characters appear on the left rail rather than the Knowledge Panel. Jason sees this form of SERP in New York as providing a multimedia-rich array of information on and about Squid Game, which is beneficial to users. However, it adds an extra layer of complexity to Brand SERP optimization and Knowledge Panel management, simultaneously turning it more intriguing and stimulating. He highlights the growing significance of the Filter Pills located up top and verticals like trailers and clips in the realm of Brand SERP management.

Google appears to recognize this fact, and while there are many fan sites on Facebook and Instagram dedicated to Cooper, they are not considered official sites and are not included in the Knowledge Panel.

Jason also mentions other celebrities who have successfully withdrawn from social media, such as Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley. Despite Knightley having a Twitter account with a significant number of followers, she only used it for a year and then gave up. Jason notes that Google's recognition of non-official fan sites and the absence of social media profiles for these celebrities in the Brand SERP highlights the importance of an official social media presence for individuals and brands.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP of American actor, Bradley Cooper, and highlights the absence of social media profiles on his SERP. An article reveals that Cooper is part of a group of 25 celebrities who shun social media, believing that too much familiarity might impact viewers' perceptions of his movie roles. Google seems to acknowledge this stance as fan-created pages on platforms like Facebook and Instagram dedicated to Cooper do not make an appearance as official sites in the Knowledge Panel. Furthermore, Jason indicates other celebrities like Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley who have also successfully distanced themselves from social media. Despite Knightley's Twitter profile possessing a sizable follower base, her use of the platform ceased after just a year. Jason points out that Google's discernment of unofficial fan pages and the lack of social media profiles in these celebrities' Brand SERPs underscore the value of having an official social media presence for personal brands and businesses.",2,17,2023-03-18 13:39:32
396,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/easyjet/,The Significance of Small Details in Brand SERP Optimization: How EasyJet Successfully Imposed Unique Capitalization on Google's Brand SERP,"Jason Barnard examines the Brand SERP for easyJet. While in New York, he notices that the Knowledge Panel that appears for easyJet is from EasyJet Switzerland, which he finds slightly unusual but does not focus on. Instead, he draws attention to the capitalization of the brand name, which has a small 'e' and a big 'J'. He explains that it is challenging to get Google to recognize this unique capitalization, and even EasyJet Switzerland has not managed to do so. However, when he switches to the UK Brand SERP, he sees that EasyJet has successfully imposed the grammatically incorrect capitalization on Google, which is a noteworthy accomplishment.

Jason advises that imposing a small first letter on a brand name to Google is challenging, but it can be achieved. He praises EasyJet in the UK for accomplishing this feat, despite the common rule that brand names should begin with a capital letter. The successful capitalization of the brand name on Google not only sets it apart from its competitors, but it also helps it stand out and enhances its online presence. Therefore, it is essential for brands to optimize their Brand SERP to ensure they rank higher on search engines and improve their visibility to potential customers.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP of easyJet. During his visit to New York, he observes that the brand's Knowledge Panel pulls up data from EasyJet Switzerland, which he finds mildly unusual but chooses not to dwell on. He instead shifts focus to the peculiar capitalization of 'easyJet,' marked by a lowercase 'e' and an uppercase 'J'. He underscores the difficulty in persuading Google to adopt such unconventional capitalization, a hurdle even EasyJet Switzerland hasn't been able to overcome. Nonetheless, a peek into the UK Brand SERP reveals that easyJet has indeed forced Google to respect its unique capitalization, a commendable achievement. Barnard asserts that convincing Google to accept an uncommon delegation of a lowercase initial in a brand name is a challenge but not an impossibility, as proven by easyJet in the UK. He commends the airline for its successful stride against the generally accepted syntax, where brand names are expected to start with a capital letter. This triumph in instituting its unique brand name capitalization on Google not only sets easyJet apart from its contemporaries but also enhances its standout visibility, boosting its digital presence. Hence, it's essential for brands to invest efforts into optimizing their Brand SERP for higher rankings on search platforms, consequently improving their exposure to the potential client base.",2,17,2023-02-21 07:14:32

Jason notes that Eurostar dominates the left rail with rich site links, a map pack, Twitter, Facebook, and more. However, he also points out an interesting phenomenon in the right-hand rail, where the word ""Eurostar"" has become so common that Google offers it as a dictionary definition, but without the usual map pack and Knowledge Panel. Instead, the right-hand rail includes related searches, destinations, and information from other sources like The Trainline and Seat61.

Jason's analysis of Eurostar's Brand SERP highlights the unique challenges that companies with very common names face. While Eurostar dominates the left rail, the absence of a knowledge panel and map pack on the right-hand rail suggests that Google is struggling to provide relevant and accurate information to users. Jason suggests that companies like Eurostar should pay attention to these results and consider strategies to improve their Brand SERP, such as optimizing for related searches or building out their presence on other relevant platforms. By doing so, they can ensure that their customers are finding the right information about their business, even in the face of these unique challenges.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP of Eurostar, Europe's renowned train service agency. Jason observes Eurostar's comprehensive command over the left rail, manifested through rich site-links, Facebook, Twitter, a map pack, and more. However, he underscores an intriguing occurrence in the right-hand rail, where ""Eurostar"" has turned out to be such a common term that Google has offered it as a dictionary definition, interestingly bypassing the typically included map pack and Knowledge Panel. Instead, related searches, destinations, and data from other sources like The Trainline and Seat61 feature on the right-hand rail. Jason's evaluation of Eurostar's Brand SERP encapsulates the peculiar challenges faced by companies with extensively utilized names. While Eurostar has a compelling presence on the left rail, the right-hand rail, despite its absence of a knowledge panel and map pack, signifies a struggle by Google to deliver pertinent and accurate data to users. Jason recommends such organizations to stay alert to these outcomes and contemplate strategies for enhancing their Brand SERP. Potential approaches could involve optimizing for connected searches, or broadening their presence on other relevant platforms. By implementing these tactics, they can safeguard the accurate representation of their brand information to their customers, despite these distinct challenges.",2,17,2023-02-21 08:00:51

Although Jennie Vee has played bass for many groups, she has managed to convince Google to call her a songwriter, which she presumably wants to be most recognized for. According to Jason, one of the signals that Google uses to determine a person's job title is Wikipedia. However, this is not always enough as Google may decide on something else.

To ensure that Google recognizes her as a songwriter, Jennie Vee has been consistent in referring to herself as a songwriter, guitarist, and bassist across all of her social media profiles and website. This has allowed her to override the weight of evidence of her bass playing on albums and throughout her career, and instead prioritize her songwriter title. By doing so, she has successfully managed to control her Brand SERP and how she is perceived by her audience.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP of Jennie Vee, a musician known for her songwriting abilities. While she has served as a bassist for several ensembles, she has successfully inclined Google to identify her primarily as a songwriter, the role she presumably desires to be most associated with. According to Jason, Google often relies on resources like Wikipedia to establish an individual's professional standing. Nonetheless, this may not always be sufficient as Google might settle on a different categorization. By remaining consistent in identifying herself as a songwriter, guitarist, and bassist across her social media accounts and website, Jennie Vee has managed to supersede her prevalent bass playing career footprint with her songwriter designation. In doing so, she has effectively wielded control over her Brand SERP, thus shaping her public perception according to her preferences.",2,17,2023-03-20 07:18:08

He then focuses on the new section at the top of the SERP, which includes sources such as Billboard, The Sun, Audio Evolution, and a small logo that is difficult to read. He suggests that having a name visible within a logo is a good idea, as it can make the logo more readable in various contexts.

Jason also highlights the differences in news sources for Chris Brown in different geolocations. For instance, while searching in London and India, he sees different news sources that are relevant to the people searching for Chris Brown in those locations. This emphasizes that news is not universal and is relevant to different people in different ways, depending on their location and other factors. Overall, Jason's video emphasizes the importance of understanding how the Brand SERP can vary in different locations and contexts, and how businesses can optimize their online presence to ensure that their brand is accurately represented.","Jason Barnard delves into the Brand SERP of renowned American singer-songwriter Chris Brown.

He recommends incorporating a legible name into a logo to enhance visibility in various conditions. Interestingly, Jason underlines the geographical variance in news sources featured for Chris Brown. For example, when conducting searches from London and India, he discovers distinct local news sources pertinent to searchers in those locations.

860,Transcript,,The Benefits of Elegant Solutions in Website Design,"Jason Barnard discusses how Google's passage-based indexing allows for the selection of specific passages on a webpage, rather than indexing the entire page. Semantic HTML 5 is crucial for this indexing process, as it allows for the identification of important chunks of content, such as headings, for use as featured snippets or in search results. He highlights the importance of designing elegant solutions that are neat, simple, and scalable, rather than recoding entire templates. By moving one element from one location to another, he was able to create an elegant solution that didn't cause problems further down the line. However, he acknowledges that there are still issues that need to be addressed, such as identifying the main content of the page, to better optimize search results.","Jason Barnard delves into the concept of Google's passage-based indexing, which facilitates the extraction of specific sections of a webpage for indexing, instead of the entire page. The implementation of semantic HTML 5 is pivotal in this process, as it helps in pinpointing significant segments of content like headings, which can further be used as featured snippets or included in search results. He underlines the need for creating well-crafted solutions that are not only clean and straightforward, but also scalable, precluding the need for overhauling entire templates. This was demonstrated when he successfully relocated one element to another position, crafting a streamlined solution that didn't spawn issues down the line. However, he concedes that there remain challenges to tackle, such as the identification of the page's main content, to further enhance search result optimization.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:49:20

He explains the distinction between retrievers and machine learners, with the latter being the ones who write algorithms to provide a set of results that users may choose from. Jason notes that until a few years ago, machine learners were not able to do a better job than retrievers, but they have since managed to become kings of the hill, and are now the ones running the search algorithm at Google. He points out that the changes being made by Google are demonstrative of this shift.","Jason Barnard delves into the significance of machine learning in the realm of search engines, particularly highlighting its role in helping Google realize its aspiration of evolving into an answer engine. He clarifies the difference between retrievers and machine learners, with the latter being the creators of algorithms designed to put forth an array of results for users to select from.

Rich Sitelinks refer to links that direct users to specific pages within a website and can make up to 25% of the entire Brand SERP. Unlike meta titles and descriptions, which can only be modified for the Homepage, Jason highlights the ability to control and modify the content of all these pages that contribute to the Rich Sitelinks. He notes that brands should prioritize having Rich Sitelinks on their SERP and suggests that not having them could indicate technical issues with a website, such as siloing or poor navigation.

Jason emphasizes the importance of Rich Sitelinks, and he suggests that their absence on a Brand's SERP could indicate underlying technical issues. He recommends that brands explore their website's structure to identify and resolve potential issues to optimize their Rich Sitelinks. He notes that solving technical issues related to Rich Sitelinks can enhance a brand's crawlability and ultimately make Google and the brand's audience happy. Jason concludes by stating that working with Brand SERPs can be a happy place if done right.","Jason Barnard delves into the significance of Rich Sitelinks, a critical element of a Brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Rich Sitelinks function as gateways that lead users directly to specific pages on a website, comprising up to a quarter of the total Brand SERP. Unlike meta titles and descriptions that are only alterable for the Homepage, Jason points out the opportunity to control and adjust the content of all pages which contribute to Rich Sitelinks. He advises brands to ensure the presence of Rich Sitelinks on their SERP, inferring that their absence could signal technical glitches with the website, such as compromised navigation or siloing. Jason underscores the value of Rich Sitelinks, implying that their absence on a Brand's SERP could reveal hidden technical complications. He advocates for brands to investigate their website's structure to detect and rectify any potential issues and thereby optimize their Rich Sitelinks.

He notes that many people assume that having a Wikipedia Page is necessary to have a Knowledge Panel, but this is not true. He provides an example of a company without a Wikipedia page that has a Knowledge Panel. Jason suggests that the machine learning used in the Knowledge Graph is becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing it to make informed guesses about information and to rely on the available data to create a Knowledge Panel even when no Wikipedia Page is available.","Jason Barnard delves into the topic of the Knowledge Graph, likening it to nodes adorned with attributes that interconnect with other nodes. He debunks the common misconception that a Wikipedia Page is a prerequisite for a Knowledge Panel, substantiating this with a case of a company with a Knowledge Panel in lieu of a Wikipedia page.

455,Transcript,https://kalicube.com/learning-spaces/talks-and-presentations/brand-serps-talks/brand-serp-optimisation-with-jason-barnard/,Why Your Brand SERP is Crucial: It's Your Business Card on Google,"According to Jason Barnard, a Brand SERP is essentially a Google Business Card that represents your brand and is visible to your audience on a regular basis. Every person who interacts with your brand, including clients, journalists, prospects, and potential hires, will likely search for your brand name on Google at some point. Jason stresses that existing clients also frequently Google a brand name to navigate to the site and may do so multiple times a day. Therefore, a well-crafted Brand SERP can reassure clients that they made the right choice while a poor one may cause them to jump ship.

Jason also highlights that a Brand SERP provides valuable insight into a brand's content strategy. For example, if a brand invests heavily in creating videos but the video boxes do not appear on the Brand SERP, it could mean that either the videos are not engaging or that Google does not see them as valuable to the audience. The Brand SERP only displays what is deemed valuable to the audience. Thus, brands that invest in content creation but fail to optimize their Brand SERP are missing out on potential traffic and engagement.","Jason Barnard describes a Brand SERP as akin to a Google Business Card, constantly showcasing your brand to your target audience. It's anticipated that anyone interacting with your brand, such as clients, journalists, prospective customers, and potential recruits, will likely Google your brand name at some point. Jason also emphasizes that existing customers often Google a brand's name to reach its website, and this could be a daily occurrence. A well-designed and compelling Brand SERP could strengthen a client?s confidence in their choice of your brand, while a poorly presented one might lead them elsewhere. Importantly, a Brand SERP also offers valuable feedback on a brand's content strategy. For instance, if a brand places significant investment into video production, but these don?t feature on the Brand SERP, it implies either the videos lack engagement or Google doesn?t perceive them as worthwhile for the audience. A Brand SERP exhibits only what is considered valuable for the audience. Therefore, brands that create content but neglect to optimize their Brand SERP are potentially forfeiting traffic and engagement opportunities.",2,17,2023-02-24 10:55:56

Therefore, it is important to communicate clearly to the audience through Google. Google is a lens that aims at people who already know a brand but also has the potential to introduce it to a new audience.

Google My Business is interesting because it is a social media idea where the user fills in a form with their information, and Google supplements that with additional information it has understood by itself. This supplementary information comes from sources such as a headteacher or a nearby baker. It is important to educate Google to ensure that the supplementary information is accurate, helpful, and valuable for the audience.

Controlling what Google shows the audience when they search for a brand name is not enough. Google will supplement the information, and it is important to manage that additional information to ensure that it reflects the brand accurately. Thus, businesses need to understand that Google My Business is not just a profile, but it is also a conversation with the audience, and they must be proactive in managing the information that Google supplements.","Jason Barnard describes Google My Business akin to a social media profile that appears on Google when a brand name is searched. Hence, it is crucial to deliver clear messages to potential clients or customers through Google. Google not only engages with those already familiar with a brand, but it additionally opens avenues to attract new audiences. Google My Business interestingly combines aspects of social media, where users input their information into a form, with Google's added information deduced autonomously. This extra information could be derived from various sources like a school principal or a nearby baker. The necessity to educate Google arises to assure that the added details are precise, useful, and valuable to viewers. Limited to merely controlling the information Google presents to viewers when they search for a brand name is insufficient. Google will enhance the basic data with more information, needing careful management to ascertain its accurate representation of the brand. Hence, businesses should comprehend that Google My Business transcends being a simple profile; it signifies a dynamic dialogue with the audience, requiring an active role in overseeing the information that Google enhances.",2,17,2023-02-28 13:17:46

Rather than looking at it horizontally, one should look at it from a parallel point of view, where Google is headed and aim towards it. Google is working towards understanding the world in a manner similar to humans, where it can provide solutions and answers to questions. Google's goal is to provide users with the best possible search experience, and as SEOs, the goal should be to create content that provides value and answers to users' queries.","Jason Barnard describes SEO as an area where there is no universal shortcut or magic key. Instead, he stresses the importance of a deep understanding of Google's goals. He advocates a shift in perspective from a horizontal view to a directional view that aligns with Google's goals. Google is gradually developing its understanding of the world and strives to mirror human knowledge and understanding in order to best answer queries and provide solutions. Google strives to provide exceptional search experiences for its users. According to Barnard, SEO experts should aim to create high-quality content that directly addresses users' search queries. This is in line with the essence of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Google's mechanism for understanding and interpreting human language.

However, when he searched for the store, he was surprised to see Google assuming he was looking for Amazon Music Unlimited, as it appeared at the top of the search results. It took him a while to find the local store he was searching for, which he believes is not a great user experience for musicians. Nevertheless, he acknowledges that Google must be getting it right based on the volume of searches for Amazon Music Unlimited.

Although there is no solution for this problem, Jason suggests that the local music store can expect to rank at the top for local searches by people who have shown an interest in musical instruments before. This might help them gain visibility and attract customers who are specifically looking for their store. However, it may still be challenging for them to compete with the larger brands that dominate the Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard did an analysis of The Brand SERP for Music Unlimited, a New York-based music shop. However, to his surprise, a search resulted in Amazon Music Unlimited appearing at the top of the results. Locating the local shop he was looking for proved more time-consuming, a situation he finds inconvenient for music enthusiasts. Nonetheless, he acknowledges that Google's algorithm must be aligning with the search volume for Amazon Music Unlimited. With no direct solution in sight, Jason hypothesizes that the local store could gain a high ranking in searches conducted locally by those with a musical instrument preference.

It requires understanding the nuances of SEO and developing a deep understanding of how your digital ecosystem operates.

Jason also notes that developing a strong Brand SERP doesn't necessarily require SEO.

Jason highlighted that Wikidata has a lower notability requirement compared to Wikipedia, but cautioning that creating a Wikidata entry oneself can still be risky. However, if an individual or brand is notable enough, Wikidata can serve as a reliable repository of factual information.

Despite this, Jason argues that creating a Wikidata or Wikipedia page is not always necessary, as one can control the information displayed in search results by ensuring that their website's About Me page contains accurate information and is properly linked and marked up with Schema Markup. This approach helps educate Google about an individual or brand and establish their website as the primary source of information.

Jason emphasizes the importance of giving information a home, structure, and proper corroboration to address the fragmentation and contradictions often present in online information.

Jason advises that the first step in optimizing the Brand SERP is to ensure that the Blue Link results and Knowledge Panel are accurate, positive, and convincing. However, he emphasizes that having impressive Rich Elements is crucial for enhancing the Brand SERP's visual appeal and making it more engaging for the audience. By appearing in real-time in Google search and showcasing valuable content, brands can establish their credibility and engage with their audience more effectively.","Jason Barnard discusses the significance of integrating Rich Elements into a Brand SERP.

He shares that it's a blue dog - a real imaginary blue dog character that he created with his wife for a TV series and a website. He played the role of the blue dog, who was a kind and empathetic older brother to a yellow koala.

The Brand SERP that appears when a user searches for a specific brand name, is an important tool for businesses to consider as it provides information about the brand to potential clients or investors. Jason emphasizes that Google wants to show its users the most helpful, relevant, and useful information, and therefore, it is essential to work on improving the brand's presence on the Brand SERP.

Jason suggests that businesses should first look at the existing information on their Brand SERP and work downwards, improving what already exists. Then, businesses should identify what they would like to see and strategize accordingly. For example, if a business does not have videos showing on their Brand SERP, they should investigate why this is the case and work to make their videos more accessible and useful to their target audience. By focusing on their Brand SERP, businesses can ensure that the information presented to potential clients accurately reflects their brand, which can lead to improved conversion rates and overall success.","Jason Barnard discusses the vital role of developing a Brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP), commencing from the top. The Brand SERP, which is displayed when a user looks up a specific brand, is an impactful tool for businesses. This is because it provides pertinent information about the brand to potential clients or investors. Jason accentuates that Google's goal is to present its users with the most beneficial, relevant, and useful information. Consequently, enhancing the brand's representation on the Brand SERP is of paramount importance. Jason's recommended approach is for businesses to first examine the existing content on their Brand SERP, starting from the top and gradually working their way down to refine what is already available. Then, businesses should identify what they would ideally want to be displayed and formulate a strategy to achieve that. For instance, if a business realizes that their videos aren't appearing on their Brand SERP, they should delve into the reasons and strive to make their videos more accessible and valuable to their target audience. By prioritizing their Brand SERP, businesses can ascertain that the information shown to potential clients accurately mirrors their brand, potentially leading to increased conversions and overall success.",2,17,2023-03-30 17:18:45

He notes that the large block of information at the top of the search results is incredibly detailed and precise. Rather than being knowledge graph data, he suggests that this information is fed directly from the source, likely through a template created by Google.

Jason speculates that this table is designed by an employee at Google and not algorithmically generated. He also notes that searching for ""ultimate fighting championship"" brings up a knowledge panel as well as the table, which suggests that the presentation is tailored specifically for sports fans.

Jason concludes by acknowledging Zack Bradshaw, who pointed out the unique aspects of the UFC Brand SERP and had a discussion with Jason about its differences from other SERPs. The key takeaway is that this search result appears to be tailored to a specific audience and is likely a human-created template fed by a source, rather than algorithmically generated knowledge graph data.","Jason Barnard dissects the Brand SERP for the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and observes the comprehensive and accurate information block at the top of the search outcomes.

He also mentions that a search for ""ultimate fighting championship"" brings up both a knowledge panel and the table, indicating that this layout caters specifically to sports enthusiasts. Jason winds up his analysis by crediting Zack Bradshaw, who initially spotlighted the unique characteristics of the UFC Brand SERP and engaged Jason in a conversation about how it differs from other SERPs. The primary insight here is that this search result seems custom-made for a specific demographic and likely involves a human-designed template fueled by a specific source, as opposed to purely algorithmic knowledge graph data.",2,17,2023-03-14 05:06:53

He notes that the left-hand rail of the SERP is unremarkable, but the Knowledge Panel on the right is where Zerto stands out. Jason points out that some of the information about the company's founder, Ziv Kedem, comes directly from their own website, which is incredibly powerful. He explains that filling Knowledge Panels with information that companies provide themselves is a smart strategy because it allows them to control how Google's Knowledge Graph understands them and how Google presents them in the Knowledge Panel.

Jason emphasizes that Zerto's success in educating Google and earning its trust with the information provided on its management team site page is the ultimate goal for any company or individual who wants to maintain control over how Google presents them in the Knowledge Panel. He highlights the importance of a well-curated Knowledge Panel, as it can greatly impact how a brand is perceived by the public. Overall, Jason underscores the significance of taking control of one's online presence and using it to shape how the brand is perceived by potential customers and stakeholders.","Jason Barnard dissects the Brand SERP for Zerto, a software firm with a presence on Wikipedia. He observes that the SERP's left-hand rail offers nothing extraordinary, the Knowledge Panel on the right, however, is where Zerto truly shines. Jason draws attention to the fact that some details pertaining to the company's founder, Ziv Kedem, are sourced directly from their own website, a powerful strategy. Jason advises that the key to controlling how Google's Knowledge Graph comprehends them and consequent depiction in the Knowledge Panel lies in the companies themselves providing substantial information to fill these panels. He underscores Zerto's successful execution in informing Google and gaining its confidence with data provided on its management team's webpage, presenting it as an exemplar mode of operation that all entities should aspire to achieve to retain control over their representation in Google's Knowledge Panel.

He highlights Unilever's effective image management, particularly with regards to its visual identity. However, he notes that the company's Knowledge Panel features the wrong logo, specifically that of FLORA ProActiv, which is one of its products, instead of the Unilever logo.

Jason investigates the relationship between Upfield and Unilever, as FLORA ProActiv is a product belonging to Upfield, which in turn belongs to Unilever. He suggests that Google may be confused by the relationship between the companies and that Unilever could resolve this by improving its website's schema markup and providing a high-resolution logo on its About page.

Overall, Jason's analysis of Unilever's Brand SERP highlights the importance of effective image management and accurate branding in ensuring that a company is properly represented in Google search results.","Jason Barnard dissects the Brand SERP of Unilever revealing four Rich Elements, commonly the apex for any brand.

Similarly, Google also relies on trusted resources such as MusicBrainz and IMDb to gather information on specific topics.

Jason sees himself as the character Boowa, and Google as Kwala, the child in the show who seeks knowledge and understanding. He emphasizes the importance of pointing Google towards trusted sources of information that it can rely on and trust, just like how the children in the show rely on each character for their expertise.

He gives the example of his relatively unique name, Jason Barnard, which Google initially recognized as a cartoon blue dog in a TV series produced by ITV International. As a digital marketer, this presentation did not make sense, so he educated Google to present him as a digital marketer. He then wrote a book to establish himself as an author, which was an easy transition for Google to understand.

Jason notes that Google's understanding of a person is not just about their name, but also about how well their industry is documented online. For example, Michael Carr, who has the same name as a British actor and musical composer, is in a less documented industry, making it more difficult for Google to present him accurately. Jason emphasizes that playing the Google game is important, as Google makes the rules, and it is up to individuals to educate Google about themselves so that they are presented correctly.","Jason Barnard elaborates on the crucial role of instructing Google to accurately depict an individual according to their desired portrayal. He cites his fairly unique name, Jason Barnard, initially associated by Google with a cartoon blue dog character from an ITV International TV series. As a digital marketer, this representation did not align with his professional persona, prompting him to re-educate Google to reflect him as a digital marketer. He also clinched credibility as an author by penning a book, a transformation Google easily digested. Jason clarifies that Google's perception of a person extends beyond their name and involves the extent to which their industry is documented online. To illustrate, Google struggles to accurately present Michael Carr, who shares his name with a noted British actor and musical composer, because his industry lacks comprehensive online documentation. Jason emphasizes the significance of mastering the Google game, given Google's rule-setting role, and stresses our responsibility to instruct Google about our identities for accurate representation.",2,17,2023-04-01 12:58:15

He uses the example of a rap star and his production company, both called 9th Wonder. He explains that when conducting a Brand SERP analysis, the rap star's personal brand dominates the search results, with only one spot dedicated to the production company. This can pose a problem for anyone looking to purchase the company in the future, as the value of the business will be impacted by the fact that it is overshadowed by the personal brand of the founder. Jason emphasizes the importance of having a unique name for a company, particularly if it is a local business, to avoid ambiguity and make it easier for customers to find and distinguish the business from competitors.","Jason Barnard elaborates on the potential challenges that may surface when a company shares its name with its founder or a significant person within the firm. As an illustration, he discusses the case of a rapper and his production company, both known as 9th Wonder. When a Brand SERP analysis was conducted, the personal brand of the rapper dominated the search results, leaving only a single spot for the production company. This could become an impediment for prospective buyers interested in the company, as the company's value can be negatively affected by the overwhelming presence of the founder's personal brand. Jason highlights the significance of giving a company a unique name, especially for businesses operating locally.

He explains that almost 50% of brand SERPs now include a Knowledge Panel and outlines the strategy to obtain one. The strategy involves providing Google with consistent and clear information about the brand and building Google's confidence by placing corroborative information on independent third-party sites that are relevant, authoritative, and trustworthy. Jason emphasizes the need to give the entity a home and signpost the information provided to Google. By following this strategy, brands can obtain a Knowledge Panel.

According to Jason, the Knowledge Panel is crucial to brand SERPs as it provides a significant amount of information about a brand in one place, making it easier for users to understand and engage with the brand. Additionally, a Knowledge Panel provides credibility to a brand and can increase the brand's visibility and click-through rate. Overall, obtaining a Knowledge Panel is a key element of a successful Brand SERP strategy.","Jason Barnard elaborates on the significance of Knowledge Panels within Brand SERPs. As he points out, nearly half of all brand SERPs now feature a Knowledge Panel, and he proposes a strategy to secure one. This approach involves delivering clear and consistent brand information to Google and fortifying this information through corroboration from respected, relevant, and credible independent third-party websites. He also emphasizes the importance of assigning a 'home' to the given entity and mapping the information supplied to Google. Adherence to this method allows brands to acquire a Knowledge Panel. In Jason's view, a Knowledge Panel is a vital aspect of brand SERPs because it clusters a large amount of information about a brand in one location, thereby simplifying user comprehension and interaction with the brand. Further, a Knowledge Panel lends authenticity to a brand and can enhance its visibility and click-through rates.

According to him, the Knowledge Panel is Google's way of summarizing who a brand, company, person, podcast, or music group is. It pulls information from various sources and presents a summary of the entity in a little box. For instance, if the Knowledge Panel is small and has little information, it means that Google hasn't really understood who the entity is, and it needs to be educated.

Jason emphasizes the importance of educating Google, which is like a child with an immense capacity for learning and an incredible thirst for knowledge. He compares the process to educating a child where the parent explains the facts, and the child goes on to ask other people to confirm the information. In the same way, to get a Knowledge Panel or be understood by Google, one needs to explain to Google who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. Jason clarifies that it is not necessary to be famous or have a Wikipedia Page to get a Knowledge Panel, as Google wants to understand every entity regardless of their fame.","Jason Barnard elaborates on the significance of securing a Google Knowledge Panel. In his view, this panel acts as Google's succinct encapsulation of a brand's identity spanning companies, individuals, podcasts or music bands. The information is gleaned from myriad sources and concisely presented in a compact box. For instance, the presence of a minimalistic Knowledge Panel with a skimpy spread of information signals that Google's comprehension of the entity is lacking and necessitates further education. Jason underscores the crucial role of instructing Google, likening it to a child possessing colossal learning potential and a pronounced eagerness to acquire knowledge. He draws parallels between this process and nurturing a child, as parents expound facts and the child, thereafter, solicits others to validate the shared information. Similarly, to coax a Knowledge Panel into existence, or to ensure that Google comprehends the entity, it's imperative to delineate who they are, their purpose, and their target demographic to Google. Jason adds that it's not incumbent on entities to be renowned or have a Wikipedia page to secure a Knowledge Panel, since Google is bent on understanding all entities irrespective of their claim to fame.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:24:46

Reviews are used by Google to not only comprehend the quality of the service but also the specific details of the business that may not be mentioned on their Google My Business page. For example, if someone is looking for a coffee shop with good wifi, and a particular coffee shop has reviews that mention great wifi, Google will consider those reviews and display that coffee shop in the search results. Thus, businesses should never ask their customers for reviews that simply ask if they enjoyed their meal, as these reviews do not provide Google with any useful information.

Third-party websites are also valuable for businesses, as they are trusted by Google and users more than a business' own website. Jason suggests that businesses ask their customers specific questions that will help them tell their story with the business. This will provide Google with even more information about the business that they may not have found on their website or in their Google My Business page. By leveraging reviews and third-party websites, businesses can improve their online presence and help Google understand their offerings better.","Jason Barnard elucidates how reviews are key for businesses because they assist Google in better understanding their offerings. Reviews are utilized by Google to comprehend not only the service quality but also precise details about the business that might not be mentioned on their Google My Business page. For instance, if an individual is searching for a coffee shop that offers good wifi, Google pays heed to reviews mentioning great wifi at a specific coffee shop, and consequently, features that coffee shop in the search results. As a result, businesses should refrain from seeking reviews from their customers that just inquire about their meal enjoyment, as this does not supply Google with beneficial information. Websites run by third parties also hold tremendous value for businesses, as they receive more trust from Google and users than the businesses' own websites do. Jason recommends that businesses pose particular questions to their customers that can help narrate their experiences with the business. This, in turn, equips Google with more data about the business that it might not have obtained from their website or Google My Business page. By making use of reviews and third-party websites, businesses have the opportunity to enhance their online visibility and aid Google in comprehending their services more accurately.",2,17,2023-03-01 04:46:03

If this perception is incorrect or negative, it's important to take the approach of treating Google like a child and educating it. Jason emphasizes that education is not about force-feeding information, but rather about explaining things slowly, patiently, and clearly while providing multiple corroborative sources that the child trusts.

Jason also draws a parallel between educating Google and educating children, emphasizing the importance of consistency among sources. Just as a child will only believe and understand something if multiple trusted sources are saying the same thing, Google will also be more likely to recognize and understand the correct perception of your brand if it is consistently reinforced through various sources. On the other hand, if there is inconsistency and contradiction among sources, it will be difficult for both children and Google to grasp and make sense of the information presented to them.","Jason Barnard elucidates that Google?s interpretation of your brand is a mirror image of the world's perspective of your brand, as observed on the search results page. If the Google's perception is either incorrect or negative, it's crucial not to force-feed information to it but instead, educate it as one would a child. Namely, by explaining things slowly, patiently, and coherently, and by offering multiple supporting authoritative sources that Google trusts. According to Jason, the act of educating Google strongly resonates with the methods used to teach children as it highly emphasizes the consistency among separate sources. Similar to a child learning to believe something after hearing it from various trusted sources, Google is more inclined to understand the accurate perception of your brand if its consistency is promoted through various platforms. However, when inconsistencies or contradictions occur among sources, both Google and a child will find it challenging to comprehend the information given to them.",2,17,2023-02-27 06:30:25

There are three different types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Supervised learning involves labelled data, while unsupervised learning involves giving the machine a set of rules and letting it loose. Reinforcement learning involves rewards for successful behaviour. Google uses machine learning to improve its search algorithm. Jason gives examples such as AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, which managed to beat the world champion at Go by teaching itself through unsupervised learning in just two days.","Jason Barnard elucidates the critical role of machine learning in enabling Google to evolve into the answer engine it aspires to be. He categorizes machine learning into three types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement. Supervised learning works with labelled data, whereas unsupervised learning confines the machine within a framework of rules and lets it explore independently. Reinforcement learning operates on a reward system for successful outcomes. Google capitalizes on machine learning to augment its search algorithm. Jason cites the instance of AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, which astonishingly outperformed the global Go champion by self-teaching through unsupervised learning in a mere span of two days.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:40:07

When producing videos, it is crucial to balance quality with the needs of the audience. Rather than aiming for perfection, content creators should focus on delivering value to their viewers. Jason suggests creating quality videos without wasting time and resources by finding the right balance between quality and fulfilling the needs of the audience.

Jason also mentions that scriptwriting is an important aspect of creating quality videos. Although it can be more complicated, it can make the process of creating videos more efficient. By thinking about how to make videos more efficiently, content creators can continue to produce quality videos that meet their audience's needs.","Jason Barnard emphasizes how important it is for content creators to create high-quality video content.

A Brand SERP, or search engine results page for a brand, can vary depending on the brand and its online presence. However, by understanding how they are built and what Google is looking for, you can start to predict what your Brand SERP might look like.

Jason provides an article he wrote after speaking with Gary Illyes, a Google ranking algorithm expert, about how search ranking works. He calls it ""Darwinism in Search"" and it explains how Google's algorithm prioritizes certain factors in order to rank web pages. He suggests that readers should review the article for more information.

Ultimately, a good Brand SERP should be positive, accurate, and convincing for your brand and your audience. This includes elements like Blue Links, Reviews, Video Boxes, People Also Ask, and Rich Sitelinks. Improving your Brand SERP means controlling the information that appears on it, ensuring that it reflects your brand positively and accurately.","Jason Barnard emphasizes on the significance of comprehending the intricacies of a Brand SERP to be able to effectively manage and enhance it.

827,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/the-unscripted-seo-interview-with-jason-barnard/,Dominating Your Brand Name by Making Google Confident in Its Understanding of You,"According to Jason Barnard, building from the Brand SERP outwards is essential for brands as the Brand SERP is the result that the audience sees when they search for a brand name. The audience that searches for a brand name are those who already know the brand and are researching it further, such as prospects, clients, job seekers, investors, or journalists. The Brand SERP helps Google show the audience what is most relevant and useful to them. Jason suggests that brands should work from the top downwards, improving everything that already exists on the Brand SERP, and then create a strategy for what they want to see on the Brand SERP, such as videos or Twitter content. This strategy should aim to make the brand the dominant entity in its georegion by educating Google about itself better than its competitors.

When it comes to duplicate brand names within the same georegion but in different industries, brands should aim to become the dominant entity, which means that Google should feel that the brand is more confident in its understanding about itself than it is in its understanding about its competitor with the same name. Additionally, it is more probable that the user is looking for the dominant entity. To achieve this, brands need to have a great digital strategy and communicate it effectively to Google, thereby educating Google about itself better than its namesake educates Google about themselves. This requires digital PR and a focus on communicating the brand's strategy to Google to ensure that it is the dominant entity.","Jason Barnard emphasizes that building a brand's digital presence should start with the Brand SERP, as it reflects what the audience sees when they search for the brand's name. Usually, those who search for the brand are already familiar with it and could be potential clients, existing customers, job seekers, investors, or journalists researching the brand. The Brand SERP is instrumental in aiding Google to present the most relevant and beneficial information to its audience. Jason advises brands to improve what's already listed on their Brand SERP, beginning from the top and working downwards. Subsequently, a strategy should be devised for the desired content to be displayed on the Brand SERP, like videos or Twitter content. This strategy should aim to establish the brand as the preeminent entity within its geographical region, outdoing competitors by providing Google with better information about itself. In instances of brands sharing names but operating in different industries within the same region, the goal should be to become the dominant entity. This implies that Google should have greater faith in its understanding of the brand than its comprehension of the competitor with the identical name. Also, it's more likely that a user would be searching for the dominant entity. Accomplishing this needs a robust digital strategy, which should be effectively communicated to Google. This essentially involves enhancing Google's understanding of the brand more than its competitors can. This necessitates a focus on digital PR and conveying the brand's strategy effectively to Google to establish it as the preeminent entity.",2,17,2023-03-30 17:20:00

By making the Google business card look professional and convincing, potential clients are more likely to convert. He recommends investing time and effort in optimizing the Google Business Profile, Homepage, and other Web Pages that appear on the first page, such as social media profiles and review sites.

Once the initial optimization is done, Jason suggests focusing on driving more business through platforms that Google sees as incredibly valuable and important to the audience. By looking at which links rank higher on the Brand SERP, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, businesses can push those platforms and create a strategy that engages the audience. Jason's own business relies heavily on YouTube and Twitter to drive business, and he sees Google as a springboard and a market research tool rather than something to rely on entirely for his business growth. By using Google as a guide and optimizing the Brand SERP, businesses can increase their online presence and drive more conversions.","Jason Barnard emphasizes that despite a small company's brand name attracting a low search volume, it is vital to ensure the Brand SERP presents itself strikingly. This is because the individuals conducting these searches are of high importance to the business. By enhancing the Google business card's look and impact, there is an increased likelihood of converting potential clients. Barnard proposes the investment of resources in enriching the Google Business Profile, Homepage, and other Web Pages, such as social media profiles and review sites, that appear on the first page. Upon optimizing these basics, it's advisable to shift focus towards driving more business via platforms deemed significant and valuable to the audience by Google. Identifying higher ranking links on the Brand SERP, such as Twitter or LinkedIn, and directing efforts towards these platforms, forms a strong strategy that resonates with the audience. Barnard's business thrives primarily on YouTube and Twitter for business growth, viewing Google as a launchpad and a tool for market research rather than a sole dependency for business growth.

To achieve this, Google aims to make its machine understand the world in the same way a human does, by building a Knowledge Graph that extracts and understands information from the web. The Knowledge Graph is a machine-readable encyclopedia that is billions of times bigger than Wikipedia, thanks to the way it is built.

RankBrain, an algorithmic machine learning system, helps Google to determine the user's intent and provide the most relevant answer to their query. To make your content rank higher on Google, it is essential to explain to Google in your copy who you are, what you do, who your audience is, and what solution you offer for that audience. Copywriting is incredibly important in this context, as it not only convinces the audience but also clearly explains to the machine. Although the machine will understand within the context of it, it does not have imagination, culture, humour, irony, or poetry. Being clear with a machine does not necessarily mean being boring for people, and writing clearly for a machine is often clear for human beings too.","Jason Barnard emphasizes that Google's paramount goal is to effectively and efficiently deliver the best solution to its users. To accomplish this, Google works towards enabling its machine to comprehend the world similarly to a human by creating a Knowledge Graph that interprets and assimilates web information. This Knowledge Graph, larger and more comprehensive than Wikipedia by a significant margin, is a machine-readable database due to its exceptional construction. Google uses RankBrain, a machine learning program, to interpret user intent and provide the answer most relevant to their search query. To elevate your content's ranking on Google, Jason advises that it's critical to articulate in your copywriting who you are, what you do, who your audience is, and what solutions you offer for that audience. The precision of your copywriting becomes crucial; it should portray a convincing narrative for your audience, but also explicitly explain to the machine. Remember, although the machine can understand context, it lacks the capacity to perceive imagination, cultural context, humor, irony, or poetry. Consequently, clarity, which is often beneficial for users, becomes paramount when addressing the machine. Hence, delivering content in a way that's easily comprehensible for the machine doesn't necessarily imply dullness for human readers, as clarity often benefits both.",2,17,2023-03-28 17:11:08
895,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/be-bold-branding-how-to-perfect-your-brand-messaging-on-google-search/,Solving the Problem of Name Ambiguity by Adding a Qualifier or Adding a Middle Initial,"According to Jason Barnard, it is important to remember that as a person, you are not just your company, and your company is not just you. Google views individuals and companies as entities with relationships, and your personal relationships are also important to Google. Family relationships, like mother, father, and sibling, are viewed as strong, close, and long-lasting relationships, which Google relies on for search results. Personal relationships should not be overlooked, as they could help in achieving better search results.

Jason also advises on the importance of adding qualifiers like real estate, SEO, or any other relevant keywords to your name in order to rank higher in Google search results. However, one should be cautious when choosing the qualifier, as it could become a problem if one changes jobs in the future. Using a middle name or initial could be a safer option as it is less likely to change.

In addition to adding qualifiers, it is important to consider the geographic location when optimizing search results. Google is increasingly geo-sensitive, which means that dominating a local area might be easier than dominating outside of it. Jason suggests that in the future, it may be necessary to use both personal relationships and qualifiers to differentiate oneself in search results as Google continues to improve its understanding of entities.","Jason Barnard emphasizes that individuals and their businesses are seen as distinct entities by Google, with relationships playing a crucial role. Google values personal associations, particularly strong and enduring familial ties like parent or sibling, and incorporates these into its search outcomes. Thus, these personal connections should not be dismissed as they could enhance your visibility in search results. He also highlights the significance of attaching suitable qualifiers such as ""real estate"" or ""SEO"" to your name to aid Google in distinguishing and elevating your position in search results. However, caution is necessary when choosing these qualifiers, as changes in one's professional trajectory may necessitate alterations, which could be problematic. A safer alternative might be using a middle name or initial, which are less likely to change. Moreover, geographic location should be factored in when optimizing for search results, considering Google's heightened sensitivity to locale, making it potentially easier to achieve dominance in local areas. Barnard speculates that as Google progresses in its comprehension of entities, both personal relationships and appropriate qualifiers might be necessary for distinguishing oneself in search outcomes in the future.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:07:41

A clear Navbar can indicate to Google that certain pages are important to your users. In addition, it's important to provide some helpful text on your contact page, such as an invitation to contact you with any questions. However, Jason advises against using negative terms, such as mentioning ""problems,"" as this can give users the wrong impression.

Overall, ensuring that your website is well-organized and provides helpful information can improve your brand messaging on Google.

Businesses need to identify the specific problem their audience is trying to solve and then present their solution in a way that clearly communicates to Google that their solution is the best. Essentially, businesses need to educate Google and convince it that their solution is the most effective.

Jason explains that educating Google and convincing it of the superiority of a business's solution is not a matter of changing their strategy, but rather packaging it in a way that clearly communicates its value. The solution should already be present on the landing pages of the website. Therefore, businesses need to focus on communicating to Google why their solution is the best, how it is useful to the user, and why it is better than their competition. By doing this, businesses can improve their rankings on the search engine results page and be recognized as a solution to the user's problem.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance for businesses to empathize with their audience's viewpoint concerning search engine inquiries. Businesses need to pinpoint the specific issues their audiences are seeking to address and then articulate their response in a manner that unambiguously signals to Google that theirs is the prime resolution. The objective is essentially to 'train' Google to recognize that their proposed solution outranks others in efficacy. Jason further clarifies that winning over Google's favor doesn't necessarily require altering one?s business strategy; instead, it involves distilling the strategy's value in a comprehensible way. The proposed solution should already exist within the website's landing pages. Therefore, the primary emphasis for businesses should be persuading Google about the excellence of their solution, its user-friendliness, and its edge over rival solutions.

This is all about correctly telling Google what you want it to display. Google wants to show your audience a valuable, helpful and useful image of you. All you have to do is tell Google what you want your audience to see. And if it's honest, Google will show it.

In Jason's case, and this is the interesting thing about the cartoon blue dog is eight years ago, if you searched his name, Jason Barnard was shown as a blue dog. The problem with that was that he was trying to sell his digital marketing services to clients at the time. And they said, ""No, we're not giving our digital marketing campaign to a cartoon blue dog.""

Jason said he wanted to sell the services, and the blue dog wasn't doing it. So he had to get Google to change its perception of him, to present him to his audience not as a cartoon blue dog, but as a digital marketer. That was his Google business card. And that's what got people to sign on the dotted line on the contract for the digital marketing, rather than the blue dog.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of actively managing how Google represents you when users search for your brand or personal name. He explains that you need to provide clear indications to Google about what you want displayed. Google aims to present users with relevant, valuable, and useful information - your task is to instruct it on your desired image. As long as it's truthful, Google will portray it. Barnard's own experience serves as an interesting example. Eight years ago, a search for 'Jason Barnard' would primarily return results about his identity as a blue cartoon dog. However, when trying to offer his services as a digital marketer, clients were hesitant to entrust their campaigns to a 'cartoon blue dog'. Barnard realised he had to shift Google's understanding of him, moving away from the cartoon dog association towards a perception of him as a competent digital marketer. This 'Google business card,' as Barnard calls it, was much more successful in securing digital marketing contracts.",2,17,2023-02-22 16:05:32

The more Google understands about these aspects, the more it can build a comprehensive understanding of the individual's area of expertise, areas of authority, offerings, and products. Jason Barnard likes to describe Google as a child. First, it can be taught to understand the company, then the individual, followed by their product and area of expertise. With this understanding, Google can direct users searching for specific solutions to the authoritative and expert individuals and companies who can provide the best solution. Jason Barnard referred to this concept as SEO or digital marketing through the interface of Google.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of developing an understanding of Google, not only for the individual, but also for the company and the dynamic between the two. The more comprehensive the understanding of Google, the more accurately it can decipher an individual's expertise, authority, offerings, and products.

871,Transcript,,Using Consistent Color Palettes for Better Branding and SEO,"According to Jason Barnard, unique visuals and images are crucial for signaling E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness). Veronique's design plays an important role in maintaining a consistent color palette which can be recognized by search engines like Google and Bing. It ensures that the images are visually pleasing to the search engine, which in turn can improve rankings. Microsoft Bing has an algorithm that analyzes images and can detect if the colors used do not match the mathematical formula for a specific color combination.

Jason also mentions the importance of dominant colors in images. He notes that Google and Bing choose colors that make an image look as pretty as possible, so they will use the dominant color. For example, the Filter Pills for Jason's red color are also red, while the Filter Pills for John Lennon's Knowledge Panel are gray because most of his photos are in black and white. He emphasizes that color choice is an important consideration when creating visuals and images, as it can affect the overall appearance and appeal of the content.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of distinctive visual and pictorial representations to demonstrate competence, authority and trustworthiness (E-A-T).

He explains that the goal is to present a complete and accurate picture of the business as an entity to help Google reconcile the scattered information it finds on the web. He compares the process to putting together a shattered china plate and emphasizes the importance of convincing Google that the Entity Home, or the website, is the correct and true plate to compare the fragmented bits to.

Jason also highlights the significance of Google My Business panels, which have a Knowledge Graph ID and are being filled with information from the Knowledge Graph. He suggests that local businesses need to start thinking about their Entity Home and educating Google about their business to make the most of the increasing machine-driven aspects of Google My Business. However, he notes that one of the problems with Google My Business is that many business owners don't fill it in properly and that people give fake feedback that can distort the truth.

Jason suggests that some institutions, such as universities, tourist attractions, and theme parks, have already been moved into the Knowledge Graph and retain Google My Business elements. He speculates that Google My Business is being slowly moved into the Knowledge Graph, but some local businesses are still only in Google My Business and haven't been integrated yet. Jason is conducting further research to see if he can move a Google My Business from a vertical into the main Knowledge Graph to protect it.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of enlightening Google through a comprehensive SEO strategy that distinctly outlines who a business is, its operations, its target markets, and how it serves as an ideal solution. He underlines the aim to provide Google with an accurate and holistic representation of a business as a complete entity, aiding the search engine in reconciling the spread-out information found online. Barnard likens this process to reassembling a broken china plate, stressing the need for convincing Google that the Entity Home, symbolized by the website, is the accurate and true plate, compared to which all the fragmented pieces should be judged. He underscores the value of Google My Business panels, which are associated with a Knowledge Graph ID and are progressively being populated with information from the Knowledge Graph. He suggests that local businesses should start emphasizing their Entity Home and begin teaching Google about their operations to leverage the growing machine-driven elements of Google My Business. However, he flags the issue of many business owners inadequately filling out the Google My Business profile and the problem of counterfeit reviews that can warp the truth. Barnard points out that institutions like universities, tourist spots, and theme parks have already transitioned into the Knowledge Graph while retaining elements of Google My Business. He theorizes that there's a gradual shift occurring with Google My Business transitioning into the Knowledge Graph, but notes that several local businesses are still solely within Google My Business and have yet to be integrated. Barnard is engaged in ongoing research to explore if it's possible to migrate a Google My Business from vertical-specific to a major Knowledge Graph placement for added protection.",2,17,2023-03-23 08:20:57

Discover is a proactive feature that offers content to users, so it's crucial to provide accurate information that aligns with your brand's message. This way, the Discover algorithm can match your content with users who have similar interests and present it to them.

He admits to making the mistake of just looking at the question and thinking about what it means, rather than understanding the intent behind it. He emphasizes that optimizing for the SERP features, rather than just keywords, is crucial. He explains this using an example of a recent article he wrote, where he rewrote the title to clarify the intent behind the article. Jason notes that standardizing the SERP feature colors, such as green and blue, would be helpful and adds that using terms like ""pro tip"" instead of ""important"" would demonstrate expertise to Google.

Overall, Jason stresses the importance of understanding the intent behind a query and optimizing for SERP features rather than just focusing on keywords. He also highlights the need for standardization in the industry and the significance of continuous learning and improvement. He acknowledges the importance of attention to detail and encourages continuous learning to stay ahead in the SEO game.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the need to find the 'best results', i.e. results that are tailored to the specific needs of a search query and not simply match the search terms. He reminds us that it is a mistake to focus only on the surface meaning of a question rather than the intent behind it. He believes that the focus should be primarily on optimizing for SERP features, not just keywords. This approach became clear when he adjusted the headline of a recent article to clearly reflect the intent.

Jason suggests that adhering to standard colors for SERP features, such as green and blue, could help with industry consistency. He also suggests that using terms such as 'pro tip' instead of ""important' could be evidence of one's expertise for Google.

Essentially, Jason highlights the crucial role of interpreting the intent behind a search query and the need to optimize for SERP features rather than just focusing on keywords.

It's not just about acquiring more contacts, but about closing deals more easily. From a Google perspective, the Brand SERP, which is what people see when they search your name, is crucial.

The Brand SERP is the first independent expression of who the brand is, what it does, and who its audience might be by Google. This first impression is incredibly important because it is not something that can be taken back. It is a snapshot of what Google thinks the world thinks of the brand, and it is what people use to make a decision about the brand.

Controlling the Brand SERP and making sure it is positive, accurate, convincing, and doesn't need investigating is essential. The repetition of the brand is also important, and it should be mentioned often enough to be memorable, but not too much as to seem repetitive or spammy. Additionally, having a Knowledge Panel can be very helpful in providing additional information about the brand to potential customers.

Jason emphasizes that it is up to the brand to tell Google and convince it to present the brand in a manner that is relevant, helpful, and valuable to its audience. Google simply shows what it perceives to be relevant, helpful, and valuable, and if it's not showing what is truly relevant, valuable, and helpful, it means it's misunderstood. Therefore, the brand should take control of its online presence and make sure that it is presenting itself in a way that accurately reflects who it is and what it offers.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the profound role the Brand SERP plays in creating first impressions of a brand, given that Google is seen as a trusted source. He considers the Brand SERP as a solid representation of a brand's persona, offerings, and prospective audience according to Google. The significance of these initial impressions cannot be overstated as they are indelible and depict a snapshot of how Google interprets the brand in consideration of global perceptions, a factor that influences people's decision-making. Diligent control and manipulation of the Brand SERP for accuracy, persuasiveness, and integrity are vital for a positive online presence. Jason also highlights the significance of balanced brand name repetition, ensuring it is memorable but not overdone to the point of seeming spammy. Furthermore, possessing a Knowledge Panel can be extremely beneficial for producing supplementary information for potential customers. Jason also asserts the necessity for brands to actively influence Google to portray them in a fashion that resonates with their audience's relevance and value. The onus is on the brand to create an accurate online reflection of their identity, as Google only projects what it deems useful and valuable based on its understanding. If it's not accurately reflecting the brand, it implies a misunderstanding, meaning the brand must take onus in controlling its online presence.

For example, if a user frequents a particular location repeatedly, it is an implicit review that Google takes into account when providing search results. In other words, if a person visits a coffee shop once and never returns, it is an implicit one-star review.

Google uses this data to improve user experience by offering the best solution from the multiple choices available. Therefore, it is essential for businesses to educate Google about their solution and demonstrate that they are the best solution for users. With Google Chrome, Google Analytics, Google Ads, and the display network, Google has access to a vast amount of data to understand user behavior and provide the best solutions to users.

In conclusion, businesses need to ensure they are visible to Google and provide relevant information to improve their ranking on the search results page. This requires understanding how Google collects data and using this knowledge to optimize a company's online presence.","Jason Barnard emphasizes the remarkable capabilities of Android phones, particularly their potential to supply Google with a wealth of data concerning user and client behavior.

Jason notes that this presents a challenge for Sendinblue to maintain control over the top of the brand SERP when other companies are bidding heavily on their brand name.

Jason also highlights that Sendinblue has protected their brand name with a copyright and trademark in the French territory, where Jason is searching from.

However, he notes that Remarkety has used a hyphen to trick Google ads into allowing them to use Sendinblue's trademark name in France, where they are not supposed to be able to use it.

Jason Barnard concludes that in competitive industries with many ads, companies need to be vigilant and employ various strategies to ensure they dominate Google ads for their brand, so that their audience is not attracted to the competition. Protecting their brand name with a copyright and trademark and monitoring competitors' ads are some of the measures companies can take to maintain control over their brand SERP.","Jason Barnard evaluates the Brand SERP for Sendinblue, a firm operating in the email marketing software sector. He observes that the brand SERP involves intense competition, with a total of six advertisements appearing, divided equally at the top and bottom. According to Jason, this competitive environment poses a difficulty for Sendinblue in terms of securing dominance over the upper section of the brand SERP amidst strong bidding on their brand name by other entities. Jason further brings attention to Sendinblue's strategic decision to safeguard its brand name with a copyright and trademark specific to the French region, from where Jason is conducting the search. This maneuver prevents rivals from utilizing their brand name in Google advertisements. Regardless, Jason notes that Remarkety seems to have circumvented this by using a hyphen, thus persuading Google Ads to permit them to use Sendinblue's trademarked name in France, which is actually against the rules. Jason concludes by stating that within aggressive industries characterized by numerous advertisements, enterprises must stay vigilant and adopt various tactics to ensure they retain supremacy in Google Ads for their brand, preventing audience diversion towards rivals. Measures like brand name copyright and trademark protection, in tandem with constant monitoring of competitors' ads, can assist firms in maintaining control over their brand SERP.",2,17,2023-02-28 01:49:14

In July 2021, he analyzed their Brand SERP and suggested that getting a Knowledge Panel would be beneficial for them. When he revisited their Brand SERP recently, he discovered that they had successfully obtained a well-developed Knowledge Panel, which is a great achievement. The Knowledge Panel contains corroborative sources that confirm Domestika's identity, purpose, and audience. Google has reconciled this information to create a beautiful and informative Knowledge Panel.

Jason notes that Domestika's Brand SERP also includes many ads, rich sitelinks, People Also Ask boxes, and Twitter boxes. The reviews at the bottom of the SERP are positive and add value to their online reputation. Having a clear statement of who you are, what you do, and who your audience is, as well as an entity home, is essential in obtaining a Knowledge Panel. Domestika's entity home is located at domestika.org, and Google has seen from their website who they are, what they do, and who their audience is.

Jason suggests that Domestika can claim their Knowledge Panel using search console. It is unclear whether Domestika saw the #DailyBrandSERP about themselves and got to work on their entity home to trigger the Knowledge Panel or if they worked on it independently. Nevertheless, the fact that they were able to obtain a Knowledge Panel after just eight weeks is commendable. A Knowledge Panel enhances a company's online presence and provides potential customers with valuable information about the company.","Jason Barnard examined the Brand SERP of Domestika, an online platform for creative learning. His analysis conducted in July 2021 recommended the implementation of a Knowledge Panel for their benefit. On revisiting their Brand SERP recently, he found that Domestika had accomplished obtaining a comprehensive Knowledge Panel, marking a significant feat. The Knowledge Panel includes verification sources that authenticate Domestika's identity, purpose, and target audience. Google has amalgamated this information to present a dazzling, informative Knowledge Panel. Domestika's Brand SERP is also enriched with numerous ads, rich sitelinks, the People Also Ask feature, and Twitter boxes. The positive client reviews at the SERP end enhance their online reputation. Essential components for obtaining a Knowledge Panel include a clear declaration of business identity, services, target audience, and an entity home. For Domestika, the entity home can be found at domestika.org, which effectively communicates vital details about the organization to Google. Jason proposes Domestika can officially claim its Knowledge Panel via the search console. It remains unknown whether Domestika's Knowledge Panel activation followed their awareness of the #DailyBrandSERP or if it resulted from independent efforts. Regardless, the acquisition of a Knowledge Panel within a mere two-month period deserves praise.

He notes that the store's name is a play on words with ""praying mantis,"" which has led to Google displaying images of actual praying mantises in the Image Boxes section of the Brand SERP. To improve their online presence, Jason suggests that Playing Mantis implement basic image SEO tactics such as adding alt tags, title tags, schema markup, and semantic HTML5 to their website.

By doing so, Playing Mantis could potentially take control of some of the Image Box spaces on their Brand SERP and showcase their own high-quality images, while still retaining the humorous reference to the praying mantis. Jason emphasizes the importance of managing a brand's online presence and ensuring that the information and images displayed on their Brand SERP accurately reflect their brand and message.

Overall, Jason's analysis of the Playing Mantis Brand SERP serves as a reminder that even small changes in SEO tactics can have a significant impact on a brand's online presence and visibility to potential customers.","Jason Barnard examines The Brand SERP for Playing Mantis, a toy store and manufacturer situated in New York City.

He notes that Snapchat dominates the search results with its application and Twitter accounts, with a Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side that features two sets of Entity Boxes. However, he points out that when clicking on the People Also Search For section, instead of a Carousel with related entities, Google links to a featured snippet that explains an aspect, which is a departure from typical behavior.

Although we may not realize it, others are likely doing the same when considering doing business with a brand, or even after becoming a client. As a result, it is crucial to view Google as a gateway to your website and a platform for research.

In essence, according to Jason Barnard, Google serves as your virtual business card and could even be considered as your homepage, as it is often the first page individuals will see before accessing your official website. Additionally, the online presence created through various social media platforms and online branding efforts is also of significant importance.","Jason Barnard explains that ""Googling"" a name is often the first step in learning about a brand or person. These searches often precede a business deal or serve as additional verification, even if a professional relationship already exists. Therefore, it's important to think of Google not only as a search engine, but also as your gateway or a virtual business card that provides the first impression of you or your brand. Jason Barnard suggests that Google can even act as your homepage, as it's usually the first touchpoint before someone navigates to your actual website.

When working hard to engage with customers in the real world, it is important to bring that engagement online and convert potential customers by providing value both offline and online. However, it is also essential to ensure that the information gathered from offline engagement is transposed online and made available on a business's website to inform Google.

By putting this information online, businesses can improve their online presence and inform Google about their engagement with their audience offline.

Jason Barnard suggests using tools like SEMrush to determine which platforms have the highest organic presence in a specific market and country. It is advisable to research the leading review platforms in the country and review platforms that rank for competitors to choose one or two platforms to focus on. Encouraging clients to leave reviews on these platforms can increase their ranking over time, potentially even pushing down other platforms with less favorable reviews. However, it is important to keep in mind that unhappy customers are more likely to leave negative reviews, whereas happy customers often do not leave reviews at all. To balance the scales, encourage satisfied customers to leave a review, as it may take some time but will be worthwhile if the product and service are truly of high quality.","Jason Barnard explains that in order for your brand to have a prominent online presence on Google, it is essential to collect a sufficient number of positive reviews and high ratings on high-ranking platforms. Tools such as SEMrush can be used to determine which platforms have a strong organic presence in specific markets and countries. A thorough investigation of the predominant review platforms in your country, as well as the platforms used by your competitors, will help you select one or two platforms on which to focus your efforts. By encouraging your customers to post on these platforms, you can gradually improve rankings. This could also result in platforms with less favorable reviews being weighted less heavily. However, it's important to remember that dissatisfied customers are more likely to post negative reviews, while satisfied customers may not post reviews at all.

These are Google's suggestions. On the other hand, the right-hand side displays the facts that Google has understood, a summary of these facts, and serves as a stamp of approval for your authority and credibility to users searching for your brand name.

Having a Knowledge Panel with these facts and summary from Google is crucial for establishing credibility and appearing as a big company or an important person. Without it, you may not be perceived as authoritative or credible. Conversely, having this Knowledge Panel can enhance your perceived authority and credibility.","Jason Barnard explains that the content shown on the left-hand side of your Search Engine Results Page (SERP) represents Google's recommendations on how one might engage with the person or brand being searched, reflecting what might attract the searcher's interest.

However, now it is more about satisfying Google's user by providing the best solution to their query. Jason argues that this approach to SEO makes it more approachable and easier, as businesses are simply trying to convince search engines to recommend their solution as the best for the user's query.

Jason defines SEO as the art and science of convincing search engines, such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing, to recommend a solution as the best for their user's query. This involves providing an answer or solution to a user's question or problem that Google will recommend to the user. By understanding this approach to SEO, businesses can work to improve their Brand SERP by providing authentic and honest information about their brand or product, rather than relying on traditional SEO techniques like links and page speed.","Jason Barnard explains that the evolution of search engine ranking has drastically shifted from heavily relying on the number of links and the appropriate usage of keywords on a webpage.

If the information on the panel is incorrect or irrelevant, it is up to you to correct it. Google is still looking for one label to put on you, and it struggles with multifaceted individuals who have multiple labels. However, Google will create multiple named entities if you have multiple facets, which means you will have multiple Knowledge Panels. The responsibility is on you to educate Google and explain that all the facets belong to the same person.

Jason highlights that being multifaceted is a problem for all of us, and that Google still struggles with the concept of having multiple labels. Employers often prefer specialized individuals with one specific skillset, rather than those with multiple talents. However, Google's solution is to create multiple named entities for multifaceted individuals. Jason himself had four different Knowledge Panels at one point, and had to explain to Google that they all belonged to the same person.

Jason reminds us that despite this being a common problem, the person in question bears the responsibility to enlighten Google that all the facets pertain to one single individual.

Navigational search refers to when someone searches for a brand name to get to a specific page on the brand's website, such as the Login or Contact Page. In this case, Google will display a chunk of links right under the Homepage that leads to different parts of the website, making it easy for users to navigate. The first step in any Brand SERP optimization strategy is to ensure that these links are available and relevant to the user's needs.

The goal of Google and Bing is to efficiently get users to their desired destination or solution, and in this case, the audience is the user on the brand's website. It's crucial to ensure that the links displayed on the Brand SERP lead to the right pages that the user wants to go to. Google generally gets it right, but brands can influence and help the search engines by optimizing their website structure and content. By doing so, brands can ensure that the users reach their desired destination as efficiently as possible.","Jason Barnard explains that when individuals search for a brand name, they do so for two reasons - navigational search and informational search. Navigational search is when a user performs a search with the aim of reaching a specific page within a brand's website, such as the Login or Contact page. In such instances, Google conveniently displays a collection of links beneath the Homepage, directing to various sections of the site for straightforward navigation. The primary stage in any Brand SERP optimization strategy should be to ensure these links are both available and relevant to the user's requirements. As the main focus of Google and Bing is to effectively guide users to their sought-after destination or solution, it's pivotal to guarantee that the links presented on the Brand SERP direct users to the pages they are intending to access.

However, the most important thing now is how well Google understands you, your brand, and what you can do for your customers. This comes down to personal branding, marketing, and digital PR. You need to decide what you want to say, to whom you want to say it, and how you want it presented before pushing your message out there. You must also be consistent across all platforms because Google looks at all the information and creates a summary of who you are, what you do, which audience you serve, and what will be useful to them. If it's not looking like you wanted, it's because you're not communicating correctly with Google.

Jason stresses that it's essential to educate Google about your brand, so it displays the accurate and desired information in the search engine results page for your personal name, known as your Brand SERP. He explains that the process involves presenting information to the machine in a way that it understands and can become confident in that understanding, even without access to Google's algorithms. He is surprised that after a quarter of a century since the internet's start, no one has thought of educating Google to the extent at which it can be controlled to show precisely what is wanted.","Jason Barnard explains that while the ""mad scientist"" in the basement could once deliver results for SEO, the game has shifted to being more about Google's understanding of an individual, their brand, and their offerings to customers.

The essential task is deciding the message you want to convey, the audience you want to deliver it to, and the presentation of that message. You also need to maintain consistency across all available platforms, as Google compiles information from various sources to develop a summary of who you are and what you provide. If the outcome isn't as expected, it suggests a communication-gap with Google. Jason underlines the importance of educating Google about your brand, thereby ensuring that it can accurately depict the desired information on the search engine results page (SERP) associated with your personal name, also known as your Brand SERP. This process entails feeding the ""machine"" with information in a manner it can understand and build confidence in its understanding, even if you don't have access to Google's algorithms. Jason expresses surprise that after more than 25 years since the advent of the internet, this novel and original concept of ""educating Google"" remains largely unexplored.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:17:10
390,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/disney/,Brand SERP: What Does ?Doing a Disney? Mean?,"Jason Barnard discusses what it means to ""do a Disney"" in the context of Brand SERPs, or search engine results pages. To do a Disney is to have complete control over every Bluelink, or organic search result, on a brand's SERP. Disney was the first company that Jason Barnard observed had achieved this, with search results like disney.com, disneyworld.disney.go.com, disneyplus.com, and thewaltdisneycompany.com all belonging to Disney. In France, a search for Disney in English also shows results like disneylandparis.com and disneyinternational.com.

Having complete control over every Bluelink on a brand's SERP gives the brand incredible control over their online presence. Kalicube, a digital marketing agency, managed to do a Disney experiment themselves a few months ago. Screaming Frog, a website crawler tool, also achieved a Disney without trying. Jason Barnard stresses the importance of having complete control over a brand's SERP to ensure that users are presented with accurate and useful information about the brand.","Jason Barnard explains the concept of ""doing a Disney"" in relation to Brand SERPs, also known as search engine results pages. This scenario is defined by the brand's total control over each Bluelink, or organic search result, on its own SERP. Notably, the Walt Disney Company was the first to achieve this feat, controlling a variety of search results, including disney.com, disneyworld.disney.go.com, disneyplus.com, and thewaltdisneycompany.com. The brand's grasp is equally strong in France with domains like disneylandparis.com and disneyinternational.com. Such comprehensive control over each Bluelink gives brands substantial influence over their online reputation. Encouragingly, digital marketing professionals at Kalicube have successfully replicated a ""Disney"" in an experiment. Even Screaming Frog, a website crawler tool, inadvertently achieved a ""Disney"". Jason Barnard highlights the importance of stringent control over a brand's SERP to ensure the delivery of precise and beneficial information about the brand to its users.",2,17,2023-02-20 14:20:17

He gives examples of how trademarks and geolocation can help to reduce ambiguity when searching for a brand.

He also mentions that time can be a factor in search results, citing the recent controversy surrounding a press conference held by Donald Trump's legal team at a landscaping company named ""Four Seasons,"" which led to confusion with the luxury hotel chain of the same name. The search results for ""Four Seasons"" were affected by this trending news story, but in a few weeks, the results will likely return to their previous state. Overall, Barnard highlights the complex nature of search engine results and the importance of understanding the various factors that can influence them.","Jason Barnard explores how aspects like geolocation, industry, and timing can significantly impact search results and the likelihood that a user is in search of a distinct entity. He exemplifies how the deployment of trademarks and geolocation can aid in minimizing any ambiguity while conducting a brand search. He also brings to light the role time plays in influencing search results. He cites as an instance, the recent incident involving Donald Trump's legal team holding a press conference at a landscaping company known as ""Four Seasons,"" which led to a mix-up with the high-end hotel chain bearing the same name. This trending news story caused a disruption in the ""Four Seasons"" search results. However, these results are likely to revert to their usual state within a few weeks. In essence, Barnard stresses the intricate nature of search engine results and the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of the myriad factors capable of shaping them.",2,17,2023-03-30 13:45:53

He explains that as Google becomes more geo-sensitive, it is increasingly important for individuals to find ways to differentiate themselves from others who share their name. He notes that while adding a qualifier to one's name can help, it may become problematic if one changes jobs in the future. He also predicts that as Google's understanding of individuals improves, it will become necessary for people to find new ways to stand out in search results. Ultimately, Jason emphasizes the importance of establishing a strong digital presence to ensure that one can be easily found by their intended audience, despite sharing a name with others.","Jason Barnard explores the challenges associated with having a commonly shared personal name in the digital realm. He suggests that with Google's growing sensitivity to location-specific services, individuals need to devise strategies to distinguish themselves from others bearing the same name. Adding a descriptor to one's name could be helpful, but this could lead to complications if a job change occurs in the future. As he sees it, as Google refines its understanding of individuals, individuals may need to explore innovative ways to make their digital presence distinct in search results. Jason's primary emphasis is on the significance of building a robust digital presence to ensure that one is easily identifiable to their desired audience, even when names are shared with others.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:08:22

While it may not seem like a traditional brand name, Twice has managed to own these colors through their use in branding and marketing efforts. This means that when someone searches for apricot and neon magenta on Google, the top results will be dominated by content related to the group.

Jason notes that this achievement highlights the importance of color in branding and marketing, as well as the potential benefits of owning a specific color combination. By establishing a unique color scheme and leveraging it effectively across various channels, brands can increase their visibility and establish a stronger presence online. The case of Twice and their ownership of apricot and neon magenta serves as an interesting example of how even seemingly small details can make a big impact on a brand's online reputation and visibility.","Jason Barnard explores the instance of the J-Pop girl group Twice gaining the association of apricot and neon magenta colors on Google. Though it doesn't appear like a conventional brand name, Twice has harnessed these colors in their branding and marketing strategies and consequently dominated these colors on Google. This implies that when someone looks up apricot and neon magenta on Google, the primary results are flooded with content associated with the group. Jason emphasizes how this accomplishment underscores the role of color in branding and marketing, as well as the prospective benefits of claiming a specific color combination. By creating a distinct color palette and utilizing it successfully across different platforms, brands can enhance their visibility and solidify their online presence. The case of Twice and their ownership of apricot and neon magenta offers a compelling example of how even minor details can contribute significantly to a brand's digital reputation and visibility.",2,17,2023-03-18 11:56:05

He points out that Google is not very careful in identifying official accounts, which can lead to dangerous situations. In the case of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, an affiliate marketer has claimed the film's Knowledge Panel on Google and gained control over it.

Jason highlights how this can be a problem for the official account of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If users click on the affiliate links, they may be redirected to other websites, which could lead to a loss of revenue for the official account. Therefore, he suggests that it's important for Google to improve its system for identifying official accounts and ensure that affiliate marketers don't have the opportunity to claim Knowledge Panels.","Jason Barnard explores the problem of affiliate marketers seizing control of Google Knowledge Panels, using the example of the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. He notes that Google's current protocols in distinguishing official accounts can be lax, causing risky scenarios. In the specific instance of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, an affiliate marketer has managed to claim and control the movie's Knowledge Panel on Google. Jason emphasizes that this situation could create problems for the film's official account. Users clicking on the affiliate links could be rerouted to alternate websites, potentially reducing revenue for the original account. Consequently, he advises Google to enhance its mechanisms for verifying official accounts and to ensure affiliate marketers cannot claim Knowledge Panels unjustly.",2,17,2023-03-18 11:23:05

He notes that 9th Wonder has a strong Brand SERP, with a Twitter Box and a Knowledge Panel displaying information on his songs and albums. However, the top result in the Blue Box is his company, also named 9th Wonder. He believes that naming the company after himself creates unnecessary ambiguity, which could cause problems in the future if he decides to sell the company.

Jason argues that if 9th Wonder were to sell the company, the new owner would struggle to establish their own brand image on Google, as the search engine results page would be dominated by 9th Wonder's personal brand. This could result in a devaluation of the company. Jason highlights the importance of avoiding ambiguity in branding, as it can cause issues with machine understanding and future business dealings.","Jason Barnard explores the search engine results page for record producer, 9th Wonder. He observes that 9th Wonder boasts a robust Brand SERP, including a Twitter Box and a Knowledge Panel that lists his songs and albums. Yet, the leading result in the Blue Box is his self-titled company, 9th Wonder. Jason suggests that this self-naming of the company could induce unnecessary confusion, potentially precipitating future complications if a sale of the company ever occurs. He contemplates the potential struggle for a new owner to establish their independent brand identity on Google, as the search results would likely be dominated by 9th Wonder's personal brand, potentially leading to a decrease in the company's value.

854,Transcript,,The Importance of Maintaining Consistent Inconsistency in Publication Schedule and Establishing Velocity and Momentum for Google Rankings,"According to Jason Barnard, historical consistency is important when it comes to publishing content regularly. However, he believes that AI-generated content can be too consistent and that Google can see the pattern. On the other hand, humans can be inconsistent with the dates and times that they publish, which can actually work to their advantage. This is because it creates a consistent inconsistency, meaning that they are publishing regularly but not at the same time or on the same days every week.

Jason explains that consistency is important because it allows Google to keep a company at the front of its mind. He gives an example of Koray who published a hundred thousand articles written by a machine and ranked very high for a short period of time. However, he stopped publishing and all the articles that were ranking dropped out of Google because there was no follow-up. Koray's lesson was that maintaining a rhythm of publishing or velocity is crucial to success.

Jason suggests setting a target for publishing, such as 100 articles in a year, to maintain velocity and momentum. Once a company has momentum and Google is ranking them, it is worth expanding the team and publishing more content to build on that success.","Jason Barnard expounds on the importance of historical consistency in routine content publication. While AI-generated content may appear excessively consistent or patterned, a human touch can contribute beneficial inconsistency to posting schedules, offering a pattern of regular but not predictably timed or dated publications. This 'consistent inconsistency' has its advantages. It ensures regular content distribution without rigidly sticking to identical times or weekdays for each post. This consistent content flow plays a pivotal role in maintaining a brand's primacy in Google's cognition. Jason offers Koray's experience as an example. He published a myriad of machine-written articles in a short span, thus achieving high rankings temporarily. Yet, after discontinuing new publications, his prior high-ranking articles began to plummet in Google's rankings due to the lack of fresh content. This highlighted the significance of keeping a persistent publishing rhythm or velocity for sustained success. Jason advises setting achievable publication targets, akin to dispersing 100 articles annually, to maintain this momentum. Once this positive inertia is achieved and Google begins favorably ranking the content, it is advantageous to augment the production team and subsequently escalate content generation to leverage this acquired success.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:11:04

He advises having a website that you own and operate, which Google recognizes as the Entity Home. He explains that Google actively seeks to build the Entity Home with the entity, which he believes should be the most authoritative source of information about itself.

Jason also talks about the subtitle and description that appear in the Knowledge Panel, a feature that displays information about entities on the right-hand side of the search results page. He notes that the subtitle is part of the Knowledge Graph and cannot be changed by human beings at Google, while the description is pulled from one of the search results on the left and is algorithmically determined.

Furthermore, Jason emphasizes the interplay between the left and right sides of the search results page and the need to control both to have overall control of one's online presence. He finds the topic fascinating and complex, noting that there is still much to learn about it.","Jason Barnard expounds on the significance of governing the Entity Home, the acknowledged online presence of an individual or a business. He recommends the ownership and management of a website that Google identifies as the Entity Home. Jason underscores that Google proactively collaborates with the entity to establish the Entity Home, which in his opinion, should be the most credible source providing information regarding itself. Jason also elaborates on the subtitle and description appearing in the Knowledge Panel, a feature that presents data about entities on the search results page's right side. He clarifies that while the subtitle is integral to the Knowledge Graph and remains unchanged by any Google personnel, the description is algorithmically sourced from one of the search results on the left. Additionally, Jason focuses on the dynamic interaction between both sides of the search results page, emphasizing the necessity of controlling both ends to gain comprehensive command over one's digital presence.

He notes that the platform has managed to dominate the entire Brand SERP, despite its relatively short existence. Jason attributes this success to Clubhouse's ability to get their name out there and get people searching for it in context, which has allowed Google to understand that it is an app and not something else entirely. Overall, Jason finds it impressive that Clubhouse has been able to achieve such a strong presence on the Brand SERP in such a short amount of time.","Jason Barnard gives a noteworthy analysis of Clubhouse's impressive Brand SERP performance.

He has noticed, for instance, when reading the newspaper, that articles often repeat information from previous articles. This repetition is necessary for those who have not read the previous article, as it provides a refresher for them. As long as the repetition is not overly heavy or in-depth, it can be helpful in keeping readers on track.

For example, in chapter 1 of Jason Barnard's book, he mentions the Knowledge Panel and what it is. If in chapter 12 he repeats this information, it serves as a reminder for those who may have forgotten or skipped the first chapter. By repeating information in a concise manner, Kalicube ensures that all readers are on the same page, without boring those who have already remembered the information.","Jason Barnard has an insightful perspective on the role of repetition in writing. He notes that in various forms of writing, such as news articles, repetition is important to engage readers in context, especially for those who are encountering information for the first time. He advises that repetition should not be avoided as long as it is presented in a way that does not interrupt the narrative. Jason's own writing practice, which he uses in his book, illustrates this idea. While the Knowledge Panel is introduced in Chapter 1, a brief recap in Chapter 12 serves as a useful reminder for those who skipped earlier chapters or simply forgot the details. Such repetition ensures that all readers maintain a consistent understanding as they progress, without disinterest for those who can easily remember the information. In Jason's view, repetition is an important means of informing the readership and keeping them engaged throughout the book.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

Users can select five different locations around the world to track their results and gain insight into how their branding strategy performs in different regions. These results are neutral and not affected by personalized search or the user's browsing history.

Jason suggests that while Google does personalize some search results, it is not as significant as some people believe. He advises against getting overly excited about the idea of personalized search, as it is still evolving, and Google is moving towards more personalized results with the topic layer. However, at present, the impact of personalized search is limited. By tracking their Brand SERPs with Kalicube Pro, users can gain a better understanding of their online visibility and make informed decisions about their branding strategy.","Jason Barnard has constructed a system known as Kalicube Pro, a platform specifically designed to scrutinize Brand SERPs, revealing what pops up when a particular name, whether personal or brand, is searched for.

He works with WordLift on an entity-based content model, actively tracking 70,000 experiments and running his own specific experiments. One experiment he recently conducted was building the family tree of Boowa and Kwala, which he fed to Google to help it understand the relationship between the blue dog and yellow koala. Jason believes that while sources such as Wikipedia and Wikidata are useful for building trust with Google, the real problem is fragmented, non-structured, and contradictory information about individuals.

Jason has also built Kalicube, a platform that helps identify the most important sources of information for individuals. He uses this platform to analyze what sources Google is citing in Knowledge Panels and prioritize them based on importance. What he found during his analysis surprised him, even though he has been working on his own experiments for seven years. Jason believes that the trusted sources that feed into Google's understanding of an individual will be different for each person and that it is important to prioritize these sources to build trust with Google.","Jason Barnard has dedicated seven years to conducting Knowledge Panel experiments, aiming to establish credibility and trust with Google. He collaborates with WordLift on an entity-centric content model, keeping an eye on 70,000 experiments while independently running his own. One of his experiments entailed constructing the family tree of Boowa and Kwala. This blueprint was provided to Google to facilitate its comprehension of the animals' relationship. Although Jason recognizes the value of Wikipedia and Wikidata in building Google's trust, he identifies the main issue as the presence of scattered, non-structured, and contradictory data about individuals. Consequently, Jason developed Kalicube, a platform to pinpoint the most relevant sources of information about individuals. Using this tool, he scrutinizes the references Google mentions in Knowledge Panels, arranging them by significance. His findings from this examination were unexpected, despite his seven years of engagement with personal experiments.

An outstanding feature of Delta Dore's Brand SERP is the effective structuring of rich sitelinks, enabling users to swiftly access support, contact details, heating management, and the product manuals. Jason accentuates Delta Dore's brilliant construction of sitelinks, which succinctly convey information about the company's offerings. He appreciates the clarity of the sitelinks and the enhanced user experience they offer by directing users to specific sections of interest. He commended the company's homepage and the brief yet comprehensive description of their products and services. Jason recommends that companies efficiently organize their websites to allow Google to understand the structure and the likely areas of customer interest, which could earn them rich sitelinks.",2,17,2023-02-20 14:00:25

This feature is in addition to the usual video carousels and both can appear together. The feature displays recent activity from the Brand?s YouTube channel and is equivalent to Twitter Boxes. Although the fastest update seen so far is 4 hours, as the feature evolves, it is expected to update within a few minutes or even seconds, similar to Twitter Boxes. This indicates that Google is promoting videos and businesses should focus on creating a solid video strategy for their audience engagement and to enhance their Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard has indicated that Google has launched a new Rich Element (SERP Feature) in the United States. This feature presents a carousel of videos from a specified YouTube channel, supplementing existing video carousels, and these two can appear concurrently. It showcases the most recent activity from a Brand's YouTube account, mirroring the functionality of Twitter Boxes. The swiftest observed update to this feature took four hours, but as Google continues to refine it, it's anticipated to refresh within minutes or even seconds, akin to Twitter Boxes. These developments serve as a sign that Google is placing more emphasis on video content, underlining the importance for businesses to establish a solid video strategy to engage their audience and boost their Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-03-26 18:18:09

However, he notes that there is a ceiling on the number of points that can be distributed between different entities. This limit is imposed by Google to prevent major institutions like Facebook and Google, which receive millions of mentions, from overpowering the Knowledge Graph. As a result, there is a maximum number of points that can be distributed among different entities, and the average score remains static.

Jason Barnard also explains that this limitation results in a competitive environment, where if someone is winning, someone else is losing. This creates a competitive atmosphere that encourages people to work harder to get better results. Jono Alderson from Yoast has suggested that Google has imposed this ceiling to avoid giving too much power to large entities, and to ensure that the Knowledge Graph remains balanced. Despite this limitation, having multiple sources and corroborative information is still crucial to achieving a high score in the Knowledge Graph.","Jason Barnard has indicated that the point allocation within Google's Knowledge Graph has a maximum limit. This is done to keep larger entities like Facebook and Google, which garner millions of mentions, from dominating the Knowledge Graph. As such, points are capped and distributed amongst various entities, maintaining an average score. This setup creates a competitive environment where gains for one entity could mean losses for another. Jono Alderson of Yoast has theorized that this ceiling was put in place by Google to prevent significant entities from wielding too much control, thereby ensuring a balanced Knowledge Graph. Despite this point limitation, achieving a higher score in the Knowledge Graph still calls for multiple accurate sources and corroborating information.",2,17,2023-02-17 10:18:26
775,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/news/knowledge-panels/sticky-filter-pills-on-knowledge-panels/,Sticky Filter Pills on Knowledge Panels,"According to Jason Barnard, Google has been testing sticky filters in the form of pills on Knowledge Panels in the US. When the user clicks on a filter, they get a search result focused on that facet of the person's life or career. The fact that the filters are sticky and follow the user down the SERP as they scroll makes them even more important for Knowledge Panel management. Jason suggests that if these filters were not already a priority for management, they should be now.","Jason Barnard has noted that Google is in the process of trialing sticky filters, formatted as 'pills', on US Knowledge Panels. These filters, when selected, provide search results that are specifically tailored to certain aspects of an individual's life or career. The 'stickiness' of these filters, referring to their ability to accompany the user as they scroll through the SERP, greatly amplifies their significance in the realm of Knowledge Panel management. If these filters were previously deemed insignificant, Barnard strongly advises reprioritizing - emphasizing their increasing importance.",2,17,2023-03-27 15:03:20
774,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/news/knowledge-panels/podcast-knowledge-panels/,Massive Influx of Podcast Knowledge Panels,"According to Jason Barnard, many podcasts have been given a Knowledge Panel in Google SERPs, indicating that Google has activated its podcast knowledge vertical. This was pointed out by Matt Artz, and Mordy Oberstein suggests that it is due to the recent tightening of guidelines for podcast RSS feeds, making them suitable for displaying panels. Jason agrees with this theory.","Jason Barnard has noted the appearance of Knowledge Panels in Google's search results for a vast number of podcasts. He suggests that Google's decision to activate its podcast knowledge vertical is the reason behind this. Matt Artz and Mordy Oberstein have suggested that these panels are a result of Google's move to tighten guidelines for podcast RSS feeds.

411,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/land-rover/,"Land Rover has an Entity Home, but They?re Creating Confusion for Google","Jason Barnard mentioned that Land Rover's Knowledge Panel doesn't show the globe icon or the official page, which means that Google still can't properly identify the Entity Home which is quite strange for a large company.

Also, Jason mentioned that Land Rover's brand SERP is a fairly typical brand SERP for a large company. They have rich sitelinks at the top. They have local outlets that sell the cars. They have People Also Ask, they have Twitter, they have top stories. They have their Wikipedia page. They have their videos. And according to Jason, that's delightful.

Jason thinks that's interesting enough to look into, but Jason used Kalicube's Knowledge Explorer tool to find out IF Land Rover really doesn't have an Entity Home, and it turns out they do! But Google is badly confused - it cites their Italian site, while Wikipedia cites the .com

The answer to why Google doesn't show it, and why it didn't get it, might be that they set up a redirect that might match the language of Jason's browser. Maybe its IP address, but in terms of the Knowledge Panel and Google's understanding of where the entity home might be, that's a bad practice because it can't figure out where the entity home is to the point at which it will show it in a Knowledge Panel.","Jason Barnard has noticed that Land Rover's Knowledge Panel is missing the globe icon and the link to the official website. This suggests that Google cannot accurately identify the company's location - an unusual circumstance for a company of this size. The Land Rover Brand SERP exhibits the typical characteristics of large companies. These include rich sitelinks at the top, local outlets selling their vehicles, a 'People Also Ask' segment, their Twitter account, top stories, their Wikipedia page and their video content - all of which Jason finds commendable. However, the SERP aspect of Land Rover piques Jason's curiosity and prompts him to use the Kalicube Knowledge Explorer tool to investigate Land Rover's Entity Home situation. He finds that while Land Rover does indeed have an Entity Home, Google is causing confusion by pointing to the Italian website rather than the .com website as stated on Wikipedia. The discrepancy could be due to a redirect based on the language of Jason's web browser, possibly even his IP address. While this may accommodate user preferences, it also causes confusion for Google when it comes to determining the true place of origin, so it is not listed in the Knowledge Panel. This error illustrates how certain practises can unintentionally obscure the identity of the place of origin, causing Google to stall in its identification process.",2,17,2023-02-22 10:54:58
770,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/news/knowledge-panels/knowledge-graph-depth-changes/,Knowledge Graph Depth Changes,"According to Jason Barnard, there has been a significant change in the depth of the Google Knowledge Graph. He noticed that the last update on November 12th was four times less volatile than any other previous update. He mapped the average number of entities returned by a query and found an interesting ""kink"" in the data. The graph had been stable for seven months but dipped by 6% the day before the update and then leaped up by 12% on the day itself.

This change indicates that the Knowledge Graph has become deeper, meaning it is returning more entities per query. It is unclear what this change means for SEO and how it will affect search results, but it is an important development to keep an eye on.","Jason Barnard has observed a considerable alteration in the depth of Google's Knowledge Graph. He found that the volatility of the most recent update on November 12th was quadruple times less than any prior adjustments. When he graphed the average quantity of entities a query yielded, a conspicuous deviation in the data surfaced. The chart had remained steady for seven months, then plummeted by 6% a day prior to the update, before escalating by 12% on the update day itself. Such a shift suggests that the Knowledge Graph has become more immersive, hence it produces more entities for each query. The repercussions of this transformation on SEO and its impact on search outcomes are unclear at present, but it is a pivotal shift that merits attention.",2,17,2023-03-26 19:17:24

He analyzes the data to identify patterns and changes in Google's understanding. He is also working on a project to choose the thumbnail that appears on Google for songs he has written, rather than relying on the one chosen by Google. This requires educating Google on which songs he wrote, and which image he wants to appear for each song. It was a challenging task as Google did not attribute authorship to him, but rather to his groups, Boowa and Kwala and The Barking Dogs.

He explains that when a Twitter profile ranks on a Brand SERP, and the spacing between the result above and below is larger than the normal spacing between results, it creates a dormant Twitter Box. This Twitter Box has been temporarily deactivated due to lack of activity and can be reactivated by the user tweeting (sometimes it takes two tweets to trigger).

Jason shared a video on Twitter that shows a reawakening of a dormant Twitter Box in real-time. He suggests that this new feature on Twitter could be a helpful tool for businesses and individuals to improve their visibility and attract more attention to their brand. By regularly tweeting and reactivating the dormant Twitter Box, users could potentially increase their presence on Brand SERPs and attract more followers to their Twitter profile.","Jason Barnard has uncovered a new functionality on Twitter known as the ""Dormant Twitter Box"" or ""Sleeping Twitter Box"".

He emphasized that a good Brand SERP can increase audience engagement, improve Google?s opinion of a brand, and enhance the Digital Ecosystem. He highlighted that tracking and measuring a Brand SERP is necessary for every stage of the acquisition funnel from top to bottom and even after conversion as customers might still search the brand multiple times per day.

Jason shared breaking news, revealing a new version of the Knowledge Panel that Google is testing. He explained that this version features two sections with filters that provide various information about brand sets. He also mentioned that Google is developing verticals for businesses, which would offer parallel Brand SERPs, requiring businesses to control multiple verticals.

Additionally, Jason shared his experiment on writing longer meta titles than the standard 70 characters. He noted that Amazon's meta title features 133 characters, and he wrote a 166-character meta title for himself, emphasizing the importance of utilizing all available real estate on a SERP. Overall, Jason's presentation provides insights into the evolving nature of Brand SERPs and the importance of monitoring and improving them as a part of a digital marketing strategy.","Jason Barnard highlighted the significance of refining Brand SERP as a pivotal aspect of a digital marketing scheme.

It can efficiently get people from point A to point B while also offering information on the best route and any potential roadblocks. This level of data management is something that would be difficult for humans to achieve. Additionally, Jason notes that some of the information that Google My Business provides, such as how busy a shop is, is possible due to the tracking of Android phones. By tracking the number of phones in a particular shop at a given time, Google My Business can inform users of the shop's level of activity.

If you go to page two, Jason says, we have HubSpot ranked top among the 5 competitors, all bidding on the brand name. That's because they took the time to ""ultra"" optimize their Google ad campaign for their exact matching brand term.

According to Jason, this is good advice: even if you have a quality score of 10 out of 10, keep optimizing. That's what you'll end up with. Eliminate the competition.

In summary, Hubspot has a VERY impressive brand SERP. They even have their own Ad right at the top, above the blue links.

Previously, Google's algorithm would determine the relevance of a string of characters based on how frequently it appeared on a page. However, this presented a challenge since there could be multiple entities with the same name. The Knowledge Graph, on the other hand, contains contextual information that can differentiate between entities. For example, there are two entities named Jason Barnard, one of whom is an actor and the other being the person tracking the API. The Knowledge Graph aims to understand who these entities are and where they fit into the world.

The Knowledge Graph's ability to match entities to their audiences is crucial for SEO. Google aims to understand the different entities and their audiences, such as companies, services, products, and people. With the integration of the Knowledge Graph into the main algorithm, matching an entity to its audience is now more important than ever before. SEOs must now focus on getting Google to understand their entity, as it is essential to match it with its intended audience.

In summary, the Knowledge Graph is a powerful tool that can differentiate between entities and provide contextual information about them. With its integration into the main algorithm, it is now more important than ever for SEOs to focus on understanding and matching their entities to their intended audience.","Jason Barnard highlights the evolution of Google's Knowledge Graph API and its critical role in differentiating between similar entities. In the past, Google's algorithm ranked the relevance of a set of characters based on its frequency on a webpage. However, this proved challenging when entities shared the same name. The Knowledge Graph, conversely, provides contextual data that aids in distinguishing these entities. For instance, Jason Barnard, a prominent figure in tracking Google's API, shares his name with an actor - two separate entities for Google to distinguish. By discerning the context of these entities, the Knowledge Graph can comprehend their identities and relevance better. This capability to facilitate precise entity-audience matching is pivotal for search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. Google's goal is to understand different entities - businesses, services, products, and individuals - and their respective audiences. The Knowledge Graph's integration into Google's central algorithm makes the task of associating an entity with its appropriate audience more crucial than ever. Thus, SEO professionals must prioritize helping Google comprehend their entity to align it accurately with its target audience. Conclusively, the Knowledge Graph serves as an indispensable tool for distinguishing between entities and offering context about them. Given its integration into Google's main algorithm, it has become increasingly essential for SEO efforts to concentrate on enabling Google to understand their entities and match them accurately with their target audiences.",2,17,2023-02-16 12:55:16

Although adding video or image boxes may seem exciting for some brands, it may not be relevant or helpful to their audience. Rather than focusing on design, Jason emphasizes the significance of ensuring that the information displayed in the left-hand rail is accurate and tells the correct story about the brand.

Jason then shifts his attention to the right-hand side of the search engine results page, particularly the Knowledge Panel. He notes that E3 Metals has filled the description for themselves on Google?s factual description, allowing them to tell their story and position themselves as an authority. This is important for all entities that are optimizing for Google. By describing themselves to Google?s users through the Knowledge Panel, they can control how they are perceived by their target audience.

To illustrate the power of the Knowledge Panel, Jason shares his own experience with optimizing for it. He highlights the fact that Google trusts him to describe himself to his audience through his Knowledge Panel which is incredibly powerful. He conducted an experiment using the Blue Dog and Yellow Koala TV series that he created with his ex-wife. Within nine months, he was able to get the description for the Knowledge Panel for all of the characters, allowing him to describe his characters to his audience the way he wanted to through Google?s mouth.

In summary, Jason Barnard stresses the importance of accurate information in the left-hand rail and the power of the Knowledge Panel on Google?s search engine results page. By filling the description for themselves in the Knowledge Panel, entities can position themselves as authorities and control how they are perceived by their target audience. This can be achieved by optimizing for the Knowledge Panel and ensuring that the information displayed is accurate and tells the correct story about the brand.","Jason Barnard highlights the importance of accuracy in the left-hand rail and the influence of the Knowledge Panel on Google?s search engine results page. Instead of getting carried away with the prospect of incorporating video or image boxes that may not hold relevance for the audience, Jason underscores the value of maintaining precision in the information presented in the left-hand rail to accurately represent the brand's narrative. Moving his attention to the right-hand side of the page, more specifically the Knowledge Panel, Jason acknowledges how E3 Metals took the initiative to pen their own description on Google's factual display. This approach allows them the opportunity to narrate their story and affirm themselves as a credible authority, a strategy Jason deem integral for any entity aiming to optimize for Google. Crafting your depiction for Google's users via the Knowledge Panel is a powerful tool to manage perceptions amongst the target demographic. Jason elucidates this potency using his personal experience with his Knowledge Panel optimization journey. The recognition and trust from Google, to allow him to self-describe to his audience using his Knowledge Panel, has proven to be a remarkable advantage. To further demonstrate the impact, Jason recounts an experiment where he leveraged the Blue Dog and Yellow Koala TV series, a venture he embarked on with his former spouse. Within a span of nine months, he successfully acquired the description for the Knowledge Panel for every character in the series, enabling him to steer his audience's perception of his characters via Google's platform. In essence, Jason Barnard reiterates the significance of ensuring accurate information in the left-hand rail and the dynamism of the Knowledge Panel on Google's search engine results page. Entities can identify as experts and govern their public perception by taking responsibility for their Knowledge Panel description. Achieving this requires optimization for the Knowledge Panel, with a stringent focus on depicting an accurate and brand-relevant narrative.",2,17,2023-02-21 07:18:04

He explains that the Knowledge Panel is a summary of Google's understanding of an individual's identity and relevant facts, and it's up to the individual to ensure that the information displayed is accurate and relevant. He also notes that Google struggles with multifacetedness and prefers to attribute a dominant label to an individual, making it crucial for individuals to identify and promote their dominant aspect.

Jason emphasizes that the key to presenting a clear online identity is an Entity Home, a webpage on an individual's website that represents them and provides Google with a full picture of their identity. He warns that relying solely on external sources like Wikipedia can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of an individual's identity. By taking responsibility for their online presence, individuals can ensure that Google accurately represents their identity to their audience.","Jason Barnard highlights the importance of Google's Knowledge Panel and urges individuals to actively manage their online persona. The Knowledge Panel, according to him, reflects Google's comprehension of an individual's identity and relevant facts. Therefore, it's crucial for individuals to verify the accuracy and relevance of the displayed information. Barnard indicates that Google tends to have difficulty handling multifaceted identities and prefers to assign a primary trait to each individual. This makes it vital for individuals to establish and emphasize their dominant characteristic. Central to establishing a clear online identity, Barnard notes, is the creation of an Entity Home - a representative webpage on an individual's site that offers Google a comprehensive understanding of their identity. He cautions against relying solely on external sources like Wikipedia, as this approach can lead to an incomplete or skewed portrayal of one's identity. By actively managing their online presence, individuals can ensure that Google accurately presents their identity to the intended audience.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:04:45

This is where everything should be pointing, but it should also be pointing out to the sources, which is part of what Kalicube Pro does. The About Page is the factual page that Google is looking at to understand the company or person. From the hub, businesses can point out to different sources to corroborate their information. This is how Google learns and how businesses can educate it.","Jason Barnard highlights the importance of the 'Entity Home' - a site's page that symbolically acts as the entity's online representation. It functions as a hub where all other sources should direct to, but also serves to link out to these sources, a task carried out by Kalicube Pro. The 'About Page' is commonly designated as the Entity Home, serving as the ideal location for Google to learn factual information about a company or an individual. From this hub, links can then be directed to various other sources to verify the provided information, thereby influencing Google's learning process and letting businesses have a greater degree of control over it.",2,17,2023-03-30 18:05:28

Google prioritizes expertise, authority, and trust (EAT) in its search results, and to be seen as an expert, it's necessary to align with the widely accepted definition of a given topic. While it's possible to present a new or niche perspective on a topic, it's important to first acknowledge and use the commonly accepted definition as a starting point. By doing so, it becomes easier to gain visibility with both Google and the audience.

Going against the grain and using a different definition of a concept may not only pose a challenge with Google but also with the audience. It's important to establish credibility with both parties, and this can be done by adhering to widely accepted definitions and then adding a new perspective or twist. Ultimately, it's about finding a balance between presenting unique ideas while still maintaining credibility and relevance with the wider audience.","Jason Barnard highlights the importance of using universally accepted definitions of terms and concepts while constructing Google content. Google affords preference to expertise, authority, and trust, often referred to as EAT, in its search results. Becoming acknowledged as an expert necessitates aligning with the extensive approval of a specific topic's definition. Although innovative or distinctive perspectives on a topic can certainly be presented, it's vital to initially recognize and employ the generally accepted definition as a foundation. This approach facilitates enhancing visibility with Google and the target audience. Defying common viewpoints and using an alternative understanding of a concept might not only be challenging when dealing with Google but also potentially problematic with the audience. Building credibility with both entities is crucial, achievable by adhering to universally accepted definitions before introducing a unique interpretation or angle. Ultimately, it involves achieving a balance between communicating original notions while retaining credibility and relevance with a broader audience.",2,17,2023-02-28 13:53:34

He emphasizes the significance of the Knowledge Panel, which presents facts about an entity on the right-hand side of Google search results. Google's understanding of an entity is based on a combination of factors such as its confidence in its understanding and the probability that a person is searching for that specific entity.

Jason goes on to discuss the challenges that arise when two named entities have the same name. Google needs to determine the dominant entity based on its understanding, confidence, and probability. To improve Google's understanding and present oneself as an alternative solution in search results, one can increase online visibility, add an initial to their name, or encourage people to search for them using a unique identifier. Ultimately, the trick is to communicate to Google who you are, what you do, and who your audience is, to increase the chances of appearing in search results relevant to your audience.","Jason Barnard highlights the necessity of managing Google's interpretation of an entity, be it an individual or an organization. He underlines the pivotal role of the Knowledge Panel, a tool that provides information about an entity on the right side of Google search results. Google gauges an entity based on various elements, including confidence in its comprehension and the likelihood of a user searching for that particular entity. Jason further explores the difficulty when two entities share a name. Google must identify the dominant entity considering its comprehension, confidence, and likelihood. To enhance Google's comprehension and provide an alternative option in search results, one can elevate their online presence, append an initial to their name, or inspire people to search for them using a distinct identifier. The key is to elucidate to Google who you are, your work, and your audience to improve the odds of appearing in search results pertaining to your audience.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:34:17

879,Transcript,,The Importance of Helping Bots Annotate Content for Higher Confidence Scores and Better Ranking,"Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of helping bots annotate content to improve search engine optimization. He explains that bots rely on understanding the structure of a page and use techniques such as anchor texts and featured snippets to annotate content. By simplifying the machine's understanding of the content and annotating it with confidence, bots are more likely to rank the content higher in search results. Adding a Table Of Contents, images, and considering color backgrounds can all contribute to higher annotation confidence scores. Ultimately, the goal is to reach a 95% confidence level to receive a significant boost in search rankings.","Jason Barnard highlights the need to enable bots to competently annotate content, a strategy that is essential for optimizing search engine results. Bots rely on deciphering the layout of a page and using tools like anchor texts and featured snippets to comment on content effectively.

He notes that the color of an image or other visual aids must be consistent throughout a website, as inconsistencies lead to confusion for the bot. He advises that making it easy for machines to understand the different sections of a page and what the content within them does is crucial.

Jason stresses the significance of anchor texts in enabling bots to understand what's on the other side of a link, which allows them to identify the content within featured snippets. By doing so, the machine tags the content and indexes it into sections, giving a confidence score based on its understanding. He notes that creating a table of contents for a page, which provides clear sectioning, makes it easier for machines to comprehend the page's structure and content, leading to higher confidence scores.","Jason Barnard highlights the need to use different techniques to help bots understand content comments and recognize the configuration of a web page. He highlights the need for consistent visuals, such as image colors, on a website to avoid confusion for bots. Jason also highlights the need to make content recognizable to machines by clearly distinguishing the scope of a page and its associated content. The use of anchor text, Jason says, helps bots recognize the content behind a link and thus determine the quality of featured snippets. This practise encourages the engine to categorize and divide the content into sections and assign a trust value depending on its understanding. Jason points out that creating a comprehensive table of contents for a page with clear sections makes it easier for search engines to grasp the structure and context of a page, resulting in higher trust scores.",2,17,2023-04-01 12:41:32

Currently, he plays a game called ""Knowledge Panel hopping,"" where he clicks on names and photos in the Knowledge Panel and People Also Search For section to see how they are related. While Google's understanding of relationships is currently limited, he believes that it will improve in the future, making it easier to identify relevant audiences.

Jason suggests that in the future, businesses can use this improved relationship understanding to find out who Google associates them with most closely within their industry. By analyzing the associated entities, businesses can target their audience more effectively and reach out to those who will appreciate their offerings.

This is the result that appears when someone searches for the brand's name, and typically, only people who already know the brand will search for it. These individuals are often researching the brand, trying to find out more about it, and determining whether to do business with the brand. Therefore, the Brand SERP is a critical touchpoint for building trust and credibility with the bottom-of-the-funnel audience.

Google's goal is to show the audience what it considers most helpful, relevant, and useful. Therefore, it is essential to actively manage the Brand SERP to ensure it reflects what the brand wants to be known for and what is useful to the target audience. By doing so, the brand can increase its chances of being selected by prospects and clients, investors, journalists, and job seekers.","Jason Barnard highlights the significance of cultivating a brand's digital presence, beginning with the Brand SERP.

862,Transcript,,Combining Different Personalities and Creating a Unified Voice with GPT-3,"Jason Barnard explains the importance of using unique words in writing to make it stand out from others. He states that experts use more uncommon words, which makes their writing more distinctive. However, he notes that using a language model like GPT-3 may result in boring and generic text, as it relies on the most common words. Jason suggests that they need to train their own language model that will be based on the language used by the Kalicube team. This way, they can ensure that their writing reflects their personalities and maintains the Kalicube voice.

Moreover, Jason emphasizes that the language model should be trained not only on his words but also on the team's contributions, including corrections, social media posts, case studies, sales copy, and summaries of podcasts. He believes that this will enable them to create a new personality that reflects the group's collective voice, which is an exciting prospect. While he admits that he may dominate the model due to the number of transcripts, he thinks that the result will be a collaborative effort that will differentiate them from others.","Jason Barnard highlights the significance of employing unique terminologies to help a piece of writing stand out. He reveals that experts typically use less common language, which enhances their work?s distinctiveness. Nonetheless, he cautions that the language generated by models like GPT-3 may come across as bland and trite, as it relies heavily on widely-used words. To counter this, Jason proposes training their own language model, one that mirrors the specific language employed by the Kalicube team. By doing so, their compositions can encapsulate their unique personalities while consistently maintaining the characteristic Kalicube voice. Furthermore, Jason is clear that the language model?s training should be a collective effort - it should assimilate not just his inputs but also those from the team members, comprising corrections, social media posts, case studies, sales script, and podcast summaries. He envisages that such an initiative will pave the way for the creation of a new, blended personality that radiates the group?s combined voice, a prospect he finds stimulating.

However, doing so can create problems with reconciliation and cause confusion for the machine and users alike. It is important to consider both the short-term advantages and long-term disadvantages of using a different name on GMB.

Firstly, humans are multifaceted, which means they have multiple skills and professions, making it difficult for Google to understand their identity. Moreover, people with common names face a bigger problem than companies with similar names, as Google struggles to differentiate between homonyms. Therefore, it is crucial to educate Google about oneself and dominate in terms of one's identity to avoid confusion.

Another critical factor in Brand SERPs for individuals is geography. People's names are sensitive to their location, and the same name can have different meanings across different countries. Google's probabilistic nature attempts to present the most useful and relevant information to the user based on their intent and location. Thus, it is essential to understand this aspect and optimize one's Brand SERP accordingly. In the future, as Google learns more about individuals, it will become crucial to prepare Google to understand one's identity correctly, disambiguating oneself from homonyms.","Jason Barnard identifies numerous issues associated with Brand SERPs for individuals. He indicates that due to the multifaceted nature of humans, Google struggles to accurately comprehend their identity, given their diverse skill sets and professional domains. Another challenge is the prevalence of homonyms, particularly for individuals with common names, which leads to confusion for Google. Thus, it becomes important to inform Google about personal identity to distinguish oneself from homonyms. Geography also profoundly influences Brand SERPs for individuals, as meanings of names can vary across locations. Affected by geolocation, Google presents the most relevant and useful information to users operating on a probability basis, based on user intent and location. Therefore, understanding and optimizing one's Brand SERP taking into account the geographical considerations becomes crucial. Moving forward, as Google continues to learn more about individuals, it will become increasingly important to guide Google to accurately understand one's identity, separating oneself from homonyms.",2,17,2023-03-30 17:26:28

He refers to the ""Entity Home"" or the ""point of reconciliation"" as the place online that one controls and presents themselves to Google in a defragmented manner, allowing Google to reconcile all the fragmented information found on the web and present the person or business accurately to their audience.

Jason Barnard highlights the significance of Google in understanding one's digital footprint, as it is the machine that sees the most of the web and probably understands a person or business the best. He suggests that individuals and businesses who have not yet started thinking about their digital footprint should start doing so now, and recommends reading his book or taking courses on Kalicube.academy to manage their Google Business Card and digital ecosystem. Jason has been working on this for ten years and is still learning something new every day, calling it a deep rabbit hole that he finds incredibly fun and interesting. He invites individuals to come and join him in the wonderful world of Brand SERPs by googling his name, Jason Barnard, and picking how they want to interact with him from his Google Business Card.","Jason Barnard identifies the crucial role of controlling one's digital ecosystem or digital footprint when determining the presentation of an individual or business to their audience via Google. He introduces the concept of an ""Entity Home"" or a ""point of reconciliation"" as the individual's controlled online space where they can coherently present themselves to Google. This assists Google in consolidating fragmented web information and accurately representing the individual or business to their audience. Jason gives special attention to Google's role in deciphering one's digital footprint, noting that it has the most substantial access to web content and likely provides the most accurate insight into an individual or business. He encourages those who haven't yet considered their digital footprint to begin doing so, recommending his book or learning with Kalicube.academy for effective management of their Google Business Card and digital ecosystem. Despite a decade of study in this field, Jason notes that he continues to discover new aspects daily, describing the endeavor as a fascinating, deep rabbit hole.

He explains that Kalicube provides a step-by-step process and basic tools that allow businesses to quickly and easily manage their brand SERP. However, he also points out that the platform currently lacks a tracking element that can measure the results of the work being done.

To address this issue, Jason is working on what he and Jono Alderson call as the ""gamification"" of the ORM process, which involves tracking the progress of the brand SERP and providing feedback to the user on a regular basis. He has set up a Knowledge Graph sensor that can measure changes in the Knowledge Graph and update the user every 2 to 4 weeks, congratulating them on any progress they have made. This measurement aspect encourages users to keep working on their brand SERP and helps them see tangible results.

Jason notes that the changes in the brand SERP can be quite drastic and that he is able to track and map those who have done their work and those who haven't. He believes that measuring the results of the work done is an essential aspect of ORM and that it provides encouragement along the way. By doing the work and measuring the results, businesses can gain more confidence in their brand SERP and potentially see more information in their Knowledge Panel.","Jason Barnard illuminates the difficulty in motivating individuals to attend to their brand SERP concerns and underlines the significance of online reputation management (ORM). He elaborates that Kalicube offers a detailed procedure and fundamental tools that assist companies in managing their brand SERP efficiently and promptly. However, he acknowledges that the platform currently does not have a tracking component that evaluates the outcomes of the efforts deployed. To remediate this, Jason is developing what he and Jono Alderson term as the ""gamification"" of the ORM procedure, which includes tracking the evolution of the brand SERP and regularly furnishing the user with feedback. He has instigated a Knowledge Graph sensor to appraise variations in the Knowledge Graph and keep the user updated every 2 to 4 weeks, commending them for any advancements made. This gauging instrument inspires users to perpetuate their efforts on their brand SERP and enables them to witness tangible outcomes. Jason observes that alterations in the brand SERP can be quite significant and he is capable of tracing and mapping those who have undertaken their work and those who have not. He contends that gauging the outcomes of the efforts exerted is a crucial facet of ORM and that it offers incentives along the journey. By carrying out the work and gauging the outcomes, companies can build a stronger faith in their brand SERP and potentially discern more data in their Knowledge Panel.",2,17,2023-02-20 05:19:35

One day, he went through all 75 profiles and pages about himself, as well as his own website, and corrected the information within three hours. Two weeks later, Google updated his profile to reflect the change from musician to author, because he had changed his description on 75 platforms to ""Jason Barnard as an author and digital marketer"".

So what happened was that Google visited Kalicube's website, saw that the information had changed, and confirmed the change with corroborating sources from Jason Barnard's website. As the same information was consistent across multiple sources, Google updated Jason Barnard's profile and confirmed him as an author.","Jason Barnard illustrated in his Knowledge Panel how he efficiently transformed his personal branding from 'musician' to 'author and digital marketer' using Kalicube Pro. In a single day, he meticulously updated and corrected the information in all of his 75 online profiles, including his website, completing the task in just three hours. Within two weeks, Google recognised and took into account the updates he had made and changed his profile from 'musician' to 'author'. This change was due to him constantly changing his job title to 'Jason Barnard, the author and digital marketer' on 75 different platforms. Google confirmed the change via Kalicube's website, which adjusted the updated information about Jason. As the sources on his website provided identical information, Google felt confident enough to change and confirm Jason Barnard's new professional identity as an author, demonstrating the power of Kalicube Pro in refining and improving brands' SERP results.",2,17,2023-02-14 07:36:15

By examining the Knowledge Panel, People Also Ask, Entity Boxes, and People Also Search For sections, one can see the associations and topics that Google is linking to the brand.

Jason explains that these associations can help businesses map out Google's understanding of their brand and identify which strategies are working and which are not. He also notes that even after 10 years of working in SEO and studying Brand SERPs, he continues to learn new things every day.

Jason also shares a personal anecdote about how he had to remove his mother and sister from the associations linked to his personal Brand SERP and replace them with more relevant individuals in the SEO industry such as Rand Fishkin, Joost de Valk, Bill Slawski, and Andrea Volpini.","Jason Barnard illustrates that by examining a Brand SERP, one can gain important information about a company's digital strategy, the perception of its target audience and the way Google conceptualizes the brand. A closer look at the Knowledge Panel, People Also Ask, Entity Boxes and People Also Search For sections reveals the associations and themes Google associates with your brand. Jason believes these associations can help businesses understand how Google perceives their brand and identify which approaches are proving successful and which need to be reconsidered. With decades of experience in search engine optimization and constantly monitoring Brand SERPs, Jason maintains that the learning curve continues and there are new discoveries every day. On a personal note, Jason recalls a time when he had to separate his mother and sister from his personal Brand SERP and replaced them with notable SEO industry figures such as Rand Fishkin, Joost de Valk, Bill Slawski and Andrea Volpini to get a more accurate representation.",2,17,2023-03-22 10:39:00

This technique involves presenting oneself in a way that Google can understand, and educating the search engine about the individual's identity and what their audience wants to see. He says that Google is like a child that wants to learn, and people need to educate it about their identity, audience and what they do.

Jason emphasizes the importance of having an Entity Home, a page on the web that represents the author where they explain who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. Google is looking for that webpage as it represents the author and enables Google to fit together the broken pieces of information about the author that it has gathered from various sources. If the author presents a completed puzzle on their Entity Home, Google will allow the author to control what their audience sees when they search for their name. He stresses that the author needs to own their Entity Home page as it represents their identity, and they need to educate Google about themselves by gradually providing information about themselves, which takes time but results in incredible power.

Furthermore, Jason encourages authors to use simple marketing to influence Google in showing the author in the light they want their audience to see. He says that Google is looking for the best answer and solution for its users, and an author's Entity Home Page presents a completed puzzle to Google, which enables it to show the author's identity and content to the audience that it deems most valuable, helpful and relevant.","Jason Barnard illustrates that while SEO methods can often be intricate, he's simplified these techniques to assist individuals in directing what Google displays when their brand or book names are searched. This strategy involves articulating oneself in a manner Google comprehends and tutoring the search engine about one's identity and what their audience seeks. He likens Google to a child yearning to learn, requiring individuals to teach it about their persona, audience, and specialties. Jason underscores the necessity of maintaining an Entity Home, a unique webpage that symbolically represents the author. This page is a platform where they delineate who they are, what they do, and identify their audience. Google actively searches for this webpage as it embodies the author and enables Google to assemble the fragmented information it collects from various sources about the author. If the author presents a comprehensive picture on their Entity Home, Google permits the author to dictate what their audience uncovers when searching for their name. Jason highlights that authors should possess their Entity Home page as it signifies their identity. He advises them to educate Google about their identity by progressively supplying information. Although this process is time-consuming, it eventually yields remarkable control. Moreover, he encourages authors to employ uncomplicated marketing methods to sway Google into depicting the author as they want their audience to perceive them. Jason claims that Google is in the pursuit of the finest answers and solutions for its users. An author's Entity Home Page offers a complete picture to Google, allowing it to present the author's identity and content to the audience it identifies as the most valuable, beneficial, and pertinent.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:05:58

This puzzle represents the information about who you are, what you do, and your target audience. This provides a point of reconciliation for your website and allows the audience to compare their understanding of the puzzle with your version.

However, it seems contradictory that Google is actively searching for a page on your website that describes this information, as it tries to compare its fragmented version of the puzzle with your complete version. The Knowledge Panel, which is based on Wikipedia or your website, serves as a source of information for Google to complete its puzzle.

If you do not have a Wikipedia page, it is important to have a well-organized website that provides a clear description of who you are, what you do, and your target audience. This will ensure that your digital ecosystem presents a consistent message and helps educate the audience about your brand.","Jason Barnard illustrates the idea of forming a comprehensive picture or puzzle on your website. This puzzle represents integral details about your identity, occupation, and intended audience. This compilation serves as a crucial reference point for your website, allowing viewers to match their interpretation of the puzzle with your version. Interestingly, Google seeks a page on your website that encapsulates this information as it aims to reconcile its fragmented understanding with your comprehensive explanation. The Knowledge Panel, derived from either Wikipedia or your site, acts as an information resource to aid Google in completing its puzzle. If a Wikipedia page doesn't exist for your brand, maintaining an organized website that presents a lucid depiction of your identity, operations, and audience becomes pivotal. This ensures your digital ecosystem consistently communicates your brand message and aids in educating the viewers about your brand.

To keep people engaged, it's important to ensure they don't try to remember and understand everything at once. This was a lesson learned during Jason Barnard's experience with creating Flash animations, websites, and running a server for his TV series, Boowa and Kwala.

At times, Jason felt stressed out when he didn't understand something, but he eventually realized that giving himself some time and not putting pressure on himself was crucial for learning. This is something that people often forget in their learning journey. It's okay to not understand everything immediately, even if you've read it all. It takes time to digest, reread, and gather different perspectives before it all falls into place.","Jason Barnard illustrates the importance of patience and minimizing stress during the learning process with experiences from his own career. Working on Flash animation, developing websites, and managing a server for his TV series, Boowa, and Kwala, he often experienced moments of frustration when he lacked understanding. In those moments, however, he realized the importance of taking time and reducing pressure when learning complex topics. Jason says it's important to understand that you don't have to grasp everything at once. Knowledge often comes at its own pace ? it can require repeated reading, absorbing different points of view, and time to digest. His experiences underscore the idea that the journey of learning is just as important as the destination, and it's perfectly alright if everything doesn't fall into place immediately.

However, establishing authority can make a brand appear more authoritative in the eyes of its audience. He also notes that his book on Brand SERPs has helped to bring together all of his previous content on the subject and provided a springboard for further development of the topic. Additionally, the book has helped to establish him as more authoritative and bring in new business. Jason believes that having a printed book holds a certain level of importance in people's minds.","Jason Barnard indicates that generating authority and proficiency in a designated field demands considerable effort, and the benefits might not immediately translate into financial returns.

815,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/knowledge-panels-talks/knowledge-panels-for-people-vs-companies-with-jason-barnard/,The Difference Between Knowledge Panels for People as Opposed to Companies,"According to Jason Barnard, managing the online presence of a company is fundamentally different from managing personal online branding. Companies have trademark protection and are likely to be less ambiguous within their industry and country. However, individuals have no such protection and can face ambiguity with dozens or even hundreds of people with the same name. For example, Jason Barnard, an unusual name, has around 250 to 300 individuals with the same name who could potentially appear on his Brand SERP.

When it comes to personal branding, it is essential to start where an individual has the most relevance and build out from there. For instance, Jason suggests starting in Leeds, Liverpool, or Paris, where he has a connection, and then expanding further. By reducing ambiguity, individuals can make it easier for Google and humans to understand their online presence, which can serve their business better from a human perspective. Ultimately, managing personal online branding requires a different approach and understanding than managing a company's online presence.","Jason Barnard indicates that governing a company's online presence distinctly varies from managing personal online branding. While companies benefit from trademark protection and typically carry less ambiguity within their specific industry or country, individuals lack such safeguards. With common names, ambiguity could stem from dozens or even hundreds of individuals sharing the same name. For instance, despite ""Jason Barnard"" being somewhat unique, there are between 250 and 300 other individuals with the same name who could potentially appear on his Brand SERP. Personal branding strategy should begin where the individual has the foremost significance and then branch out. Jason, for example, suggests initiating in Leeds, Liverpool, or Paris, where he maintains connections, and then extending further. This strategic reduction of ambiguity facilitates both Google and human users in discerning their online persona, ultimately better servicing their business from a human perspective. Therefore, it's crucial to understand that managing individual online branding necessitates a distinct approach compared to managing a company's online visibility.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:37:11
869,Transcript,,Recognizing Authorship Through Writing Style and the Importance of Maintaining a Personalized Voice,"According to Jason Barnard, writing the initial text is difficult, but once it's written, the task becomes easier. The job of writing then becomes the process of refining and improving the text. This is because algorithms are changing the way we write, and a new algorithmic authorship message is emerging.

Google is trying to recognize authorship so that it can identify who the expert is. If Google can recognize a writer's style, it can recognize them as an expert. This means that if someone else writes an article for you and you put your name on it, Google will recognize that the writing style is not yours. It is important to correct machine-generated text to ensure that it matches your authorship style.

Google aims to understand who is writing based on the way they phrase themselves, the way they turn sentences around, and the type of vocabulary they use. Even using unusual phrases like ""rather optimizing for the SERP"" can help Google identify a writer's style. However, there is a balance between using tools like InstaText to make text clearer and retaining personality in writing. As algorithms become better at recognizing authorship, it is essential to ensure that machine-generated text matches your authorship style.","Jason Barnard indicates that the initial phase of writing can be challenging, yet once the foundation is set, enhancements and refinements follow more smoothly. This evolving procedure of writing is driven by the alteration in algorithms, culminating in a unique algorithmic authorship signature. Google is keen on identifying authorship to pinpoint the expertise in the subject matter. If it can decipher a writer's unique style, Google can then categorize them as a subject expert. This implies that if you were to attribute an article written by someone else to your name, Google could detect the divergence in writing styles. As such, it is crucial to tweak machine-generated text to maintain consistency with your individual authorship style. Google strives to identify the author based on their distinct phrasing, sentence construction, and vocabulary selection. Even the inclusion of unusual phrases like ""rather optimizing for the SERP"" can aid Google in determining the writer's style. However, striking a balance is vital - while tools like InstaText are beneficial in clarifying text, retaining personalization in your writing holds equal weight. As Google's algorithms continue to improve in discerning authorship, aligning machine-generated text with your personalized writing style becomes increasingly crucial.

Jason reveals that this pub holds a special place in his heart as it was the location of his first legal pint of beer. He points out that the search results are not accurate since the first listing is for a pub in Oldham, 35 miles away from Otley.

Jason notes that the incorrect listing ranks first despite the distance, which could be because it has a one-page website. He suggests that The Junction Inn should create a website to rank number one in search results. With a website, the correct pub would be at the top of the Brand SERP, providing accurate information and enticing potential customers with menus and event information.

Jason's analysis highlights the importance of accurate and relevant search results for businesses. Having a website can improve a brand's online presence and help them rank higher in search results, leading to increased visibility and potential customers.

Jason suggests that having an Entity Home that one owns and controls is essential for people, especially famous individuals who are likely to have bursts of news around them.

800,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/brand-serps-talks/brand-serps-by-jason-barnard/,Geolocation and Trademarking Helps Google Differentiate Entities More Specifically and Give a More Accurate Answer or Solution to Its Users,"According to Jason Barnard, the problem of name ambiguity exists because as humans, we tend to share names. However, this problem is less common with brands because each individual company has copyright and trademark protection. Although the same brand name can exist in different industries within the same country, there is geolocation and trademark protection that provides a double kind of protection. For example, if you search for Paper Gecko, the digital marketing agency of David Sayce in the UK, there are multiple companies with the same name in the UK and the US, but Google can differentiate them between the two countries because of their location.

Jason also suggested a few ways to disambiguate a name search. One way is to add a middle initial, which helps to disambiguate the search. Another way is to have a website that represents you as an entity, like what Ben Shapiro should do, instead of letting Google think that Twitter is the best representative of him. Shapiro's official site on his Knowledge Panel is Twitter.com, which is a mistake because Twitter then has control of his entity. On the other hand, Benjamin Shapiro's entity lives on Benshap.com, which is much better.","Jason Barnard is of the opinion that the predicament of name ambiguity arises primarily due to the commonality of certain human names. However, he submits that this issue isn't as prevalent among brands, given that individual companies enjoy copyright and trademark protections. While the use of an identical brand name across various industries within a nation is possible, the combination of geolocation and trademark protection offers a two-fold safeguard. For instance, multiple firms named Paper Gecko exist in both the UK and the US, belonging to UK-based digital marketer David Sayce. Despite this, Google can discriminate between entities from the two nations based on their respective locations. To aid in name search disambiguation, Jason suggests several methods. One such method involves adding a middle initial. Another strategy advocates for establishing a personal website that encapsulates one's entity, as should have been undertaken by Ben Shapiro, instead of erroneously permitting Google to view Twitter as his best representative. With Shapiro's official site on his Knowledge Panel being Twitter.com, Twitter inevitably wields control over his entity. Conversely, Benjamin Shapiro's entity is identified with Benshap.com, which is a far superior arrangement.",2,17,2023-03-30 13:44:25

Jason explains that ranking number one for one's own name is natural in the SEO industry. However, Brand SERPs delve deeper and analyze what Google or Bing deems relevant, helpful, and useful to the audience who are a subset of its users.

Jason emphasizes that Brand SERPs go beyond the first search result and down the SERP. He describes Brand SERPs as a ""Google business card"" or ""Bing business card"" that shapes how the audience perceives a brand or individual. Since the audience is already familiar with the brand, the information displayed on the Brand SERP is incredibly important to how they perceive the brand now and moving forward.

Jason stresses that it is essential for businesses to manage their Brand SERPs actively. He suggests that businesses should think about what they want to appear on their Brand SERPs and work towards that goal. Managing Brand SERPs can help businesses control their online reputation and establish themselves as industry experts.","Jason Barnard is widely recognized as ""The Brand SERP Guy,"" and he provides insightful clarification on the notion of Brand SERPs. These are the search engine results pages shown when a user searches for a brand or individual's name. According to him, achieving the top spot on the search results page for one's name is a common practice in the SEO realm. Still, Brand SERPs offer a much more comprehensive perspective, focusing on what search engines like Google or Bing consider relevant and beneficial to subset users engaging with the brand.

Barnard insists that Brand SERPs aren't just about occupying the first search result; they extend down the SERP, acting like a 'business card' for the brand on platforms like Google or Bing, significantly influencing the audience's impression of a brand or a person. The audience, having prior knowledge of the brand, will use the data displayed on the Brand SERP to inform their current and future perception of the brand.

He reinforces the importance of businesses proactively managing their Brand SERPs to control their online visibility and reputation effectively. By directing their attention to how their Brand SERPs appear, businesses can exert control over their online reputation and cement their status as industry authorities. He posits that this strategic management of Brand SERPs can greatly aid businesses in their journey towards reputation control and industry expertise.",2,17,2023-03-27 15:19:49

Jason is passionate about Brand SERPs because he believes they are helpful for understanding how Google works and what it does with its various algorithms.

As a digital marketer, it is important to educate Google about your personal brand so that it can accurately present you to the world.

As digital marketers, we need to educate Google to understand our personal brand message and show it the way we want it to be shown. We have a responsibility to explain to Google what we want it to say, and as long as it is truthful and corroborated around the web, Google will represent us the way we want it to.

Jason emphasizes the importance of paying attention to our digital ecosystem, which is the contradictory and fragmented version of ourselves spread around the internet. Google is trying to make sense of it like a child with a broken plate, fitting the pieces together into the full plate. However, it can only do so if the digital ecosystem is not too messy, and it is looking for the full version presented by the person, which most people do not provide. Therefore, Google is struggling to find the completed puzzle and looking for an Entity Home, or the point of reconciliation, which is where it can find the information about the person from the person themselves.","Jason Barnard likens Google's attempts to comprehend the world to those of a child. He mentions that Google has built a gargantuan information hub called the Knowledge Graph, housing some 1,500 billion facts. As a digital marketer, he suggests that it is crucial to provide clear instruction to Google about our personal brand so that it can accurately present us to the world. We must communicate our desired brand representation, providing verifiable and honest information to ensure the desired depiction. Jason underlines the significance of monitoring our digital ecosystem, which comprises potentially disparate and conflicting online fragments of ourselves. Google, much like a child trying to assemble a broken plate, seeks to piece together these parts into a coherent whole. However, Google's efforts are hampered if the digital ecosystem is chaotic and lacks a cohesive narrative provided by the individual involved.

If a company wants to dominate its Brand SERP, it needs to understand how Google perceives the brand and the sources it is getting that information from. Jason has built a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform that can track a brand's mentions and provide information about the sources Google uses to educate itself about that brand. By using this information, businesses can build their confidence and influence Google's perception of their brand.

Jason emphasized that even if someone at Google corrects information about a brand, the search engine's algorithmic decision-making process can override it. He gave an example of a client who had two authors with the same name and Google kept mixing up their books. Although the client asked someone at Google to correct it, the child-like algorithm ultimately made the decision. He suggests that having an Entity Home, which is a website controlled by the brand, can help in such situations. The child would look to the brand's website for information, instead of relying on external sources, thus making it easier to maintain control over its Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard likens Google's search engine to a child that absorbs information presented to it. If a company seeks to take control of its Brand SERP, it needs to comprehend how Google interprets the brand and the sources it consults for that information. Jason has engineered a Software as a Service (SaaS) platform capable of tracking brand mentions and providing insights into the sources Google employs to educate itself about that particular brand. Leveraging this information, businesses can build confidence and influence how Google perceives their brand. Jason stressed that even if a Google insider rectifies brand information, the search engine's algorithmic decision-making process may supersede such corrections. He cited the case of a client with two authors sharing the same name, causing Google to continually confuse their books. Despite the client's plea for correction to a Google representative, the algorithm, acting like a child, made the ultimate decision. He advocates for the creation of an Entity Home?a brand-controlled website?that can assist in such circumstances.

Jason and his daughter play a language game where they try to guess the language of a film they watch. He often cannot differentiate between languages, as they all sound the same in his brain. However, he feels more self-conscious about his French accent when speaking on live video than his English accent. Despite being bilingual, he feels uncomfortable doing live shows in French and would prefer to do them in English.

Jason's experience highlights the complexity of being bilingual and the impact of personal insecurities on language use. Despite being fluent in French, he still feels self-conscious about his accent and prefers to speak in English. This suggests that language proficiency is not the only factor that determines language preference or comfort. Personal feelings and social contexts can also play a significant role.","Jason Barnard narrated his journey of becoming bilingual in a recent discussion. He disclosed that his relationship with his ex-wife, who was averse to learning English, motivated him to master French. The language now flows organically for him, requiring no translation from English.

However, Jason admitted to being more self-conscious about his French accent in live video sessions compared to his English accent. Being bilingual, he still experiences unease when conducting live programs in French and demonstrates a preference for English. Jason's narrative reveals the intricate nature of bilingualism and the influence personal apprehensions can exert on language usage.

Although brands have the capability to influence these elements to varying degrees, the process can be complex and unique for each element and brand.

Each rich element operates with an algorithm, which is influenced by numerous factors, each carrying a specific weighting. All of these elements compete for limited space on the first page of the search engine results page (SERP) for your brand.

The key is to determine which elements have a viable possibility of appearing on your brand's page and which do not. Focus your efforts on those elements that you can realistically expect to attain, and work towards them consistently over time. None of these elements will materialize overnight, nor is there a simple solution to acquiring them. However, when achieved, they can greatly enhance the credibility of your brand to clients, partners, distributors, suppliers, employees, investors, journalists, and others when they search for information about your brand on Google.","Jason Barnard offers valuable insights into navigating and optimizing Google's array of Rich Elements, an endeavor any brand can realistically aspire to.

He mentions that if a specific social media platform is not ranking in the SERP, it is a sign that the strategy for that platform needs to be evaluated. It is important to question why the audience is not engaging or why Google is not recognizing their engagement. Additionally, LinkedIn tends to rank in the SERP because it is an informational business platform, especially for B2B. However, different social media platforms dominate in different industries, and it is essential to research which platforms are the most influential in each industry. Kalicube has data that can help determine which social media platforms dominate in a specific industry. For example, in the literature industry, LinkedIn does not appear in the SERP because it is B2B, and Twitter dominates over Facebook.","Jason Barnard outlines the significance of social media platforms in influencing Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). He points out that if marked social media platforms are absent from a brand's SERP rankings, it's crucial to reassess the brand's strategy for that platform.

Firstly, it is important for the audience, including clients, prospects, investors, and partners, who are likely to Google a company's brand name at some point during their journey with the business. This means that a Brand SERP serves as a virtual business card, representing the company's brand and its level of professionalism and credibility.

Jason emphasizes that in today's digital age, people are more likely to Google a brand name than to exchange physical business cards. Therefore, a strong Brand SERP is critical for building brand awareness and establishing a positive first impression.

As The Brand SERP Guy, Jason aims to raise awareness about the importance of a strong and positive Brand SERP, and to provide guidance on how to improve it.

First, it serves a significant role for audiences consisting of prospective clients, existing customers, potential investors, and partners.

To do this, you must improve your Digital Ecosystem by replacing bad reviews with good ones, investing in videos that appear on your Brand SERP, and making your Brand SERP positive, accurate, and convincing. The goal is to get Google to recommend your product to its audience, and a good Brand SERP is a reflection of your trustworthiness, authority, and expertise.

Jason explains that understanding the anatomy of a Brand SERP is important for predicting what it might look like. He provides an article called Darwinism in Search, which explains how Google's ranking algorithm works. A typical Brand SERP includes Blue Links, Reviews, Video Boxes, People Also Ask, and Rich Sitelinks. However, the specific elements on a Brand SERP will vary depending on the industry, digital marketing strategy, and control exercised over it.

Finally, Jason emphasizes that control is the key to creating a great Brand SERP. Unlike traditional SEO where you have no control, on Brand SERPs, you have immense control over how your brand is reflected. Google wants to be honest about you, and all you need to do is pull the right levers to get a great Brand SERP. Typically, you can expect seven Blue Links and three Rich Elements, but the actual content will depend on your digital marketing strategy and how much control you exercise.","Jason Barnard places great importance on enhancing a Brand SERP, or search engine results page for your brand, which is a major component of a successful digital marketing strategy. This involves refining your Digital Ecosystem, for instance, replacing unfavorable reviews with positive ones and developing videos that are prominently displayed on your Brand SERP. The goal is to establish your brand SERP in a positive, precise, and compelling manner that persuades Google to recommend your product to its users. A sound Brand SERP mirrors your authenticity, authority, and expertise.
To predict what a Brand SERP might look like, Jason emphasizes the significance of understanding its structure. He refers to his article, ""Darwinism in Search,"" which sheds light on the working of Google's ranking algorithm. Ordinarily, a Brand SERP encompasses elements such as Blue Links, Reviews, Video Boxes, People Also Ask, and Rich Sitelinks. However, the concrete elements in a Brand SERP are contingent on the brand's sector, digital marketing tactics, and the level of control it exerts over its online image. Lastly, Jason underscores that exerting control is the key to crafting an exceptional Brand SERP. Unlike traditional SEO where control might be limited, with Brand SERPs, there's significant control over how the brand is depicted. Google seeks to provide an honest representation of the brand, and the onus lies on the brand to pull the correct levers and achieve a superior Brand SERP. Typically, a Brand SERP includes seven Blue Links and three Rich Elements, though the actual content might fluctuate based on the digital marketing strategy and the degree of control the brand exemplifies.",2,17,2023-03-23 13:08:31
856,Transcript,,The Importance of Micro Semantics in SEO Content Writing,"According to Jason Barnard, micro semantics is the key to successful content creation. Micro semantics involves thinking about related terms and topics that are not necessarily obvious when writing about a subject. For example, if writing about Brand SERPs, one should also mention topics such as podcasts, Google Search, branding, and marketing departments. Micro semantics is all about adding the necessary details and information to an article to make it stand out and provide value to the reader.

Jason believes that micro semantics is crucial to content creation and that every article should have related terms and topics that make sense but may not be immediately obvious. He frequently rewrites and rephrases articles to add more detail and micro semantics, making sure that every piece of content published by his team is valuable and informative. Jason's focus is on creating content with depth, breadth, and velocity, with micro semantics playing a vital role in achieving this goal.","Jason Barnard places significant emphasis on the role of micro semantics in crafting successful content. This technique involves the inclusion of related yet potentially non-obvious terms and topics when authoring a piece on a particular subject. Illustratively, when writing about Brand SERPs, incorporating discussions on associated matters like podcasts, Google Search, branding, and marketing departments is advisable. Micro semantics revolves around enriching an article with pertinent information and details to distinguish it and equip it with greater value for the reader. Jason perceives micro semantics as indispensable in content creation, advocating for the integration of related yet subtly nuanced terms and topics in every write-up. His process often involves revising and rewording articles to embed more detailed micro semantics, ensuring every content piece dispensed by his team resonates value and informativeness. Central to Jason's content creation philosophy is the pursuit of depth, breadth, and velocity, with micro semantics serving as a critical component in accomplishing this aim.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:23:18
845,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/the-unscripted-seo-interview-with-jason-barnard/,"Be Clear About Who You Are, What You Do, and Who Your Audience Is While Still Making It Interesting and Attractive","According to Jason Barnard, many companies make the mistake of starting their About Us Page with a historical timeline of the company, which is not what their audience is interested in. Instead, they should start with what they are doing right now, as that is what Google sees as the most relevant and important. It is also important to be specific about what the company does for its audience, rather than stating a vague mission. Being clear about the facts is important for Google to understand, but the copywriting should still be interesting and attractive to the human audience.

Jason emphasizes the importance of the company description in the Knowledge Panel, which is the single most important thing for a Done for You Service. The description needs to be factually simple for Google to understand but attractive to the human audience. He mentions that this is an art that many companies fail to master. However, with Kalicube Pro's Done for You Service, they are starting to master the art of creating an attractive and informative company description.","Jason Barnard points out a common misstep by many companies - launching their 'About Us' page with a chronological company history. He underscores starting with the company's current activities since Google views that as the most relevant and essential data. A clear, specific description of what the company offers to its consumers is vital, as opposed to a broad, vague mission statement. The significance of ensuring that facts are distinctly outlined for Google to fathom without losing the narrative appeal to human readers is emphasized by Jason. He particularly highlights the role of the company description in the Knowledge Panel, terming it the most crucial aspect for a Done for You Service. Companies often struggle to compose a simple synopsis for Google's understanding that is likewise engaging to human visitors. Yet, with Kalicube Pro's Done for You Service, companies are starting to master this intricate art of crafting an enticing and enlightening company description.",2,17,2023-03-30 18:10:33
861,Transcript,,The Importance of Using Unique Words in Writing and Training Language Models,"According to Jason Barnard, experts tend to use more unique words compared to non-experts. However, when using GPT-3, the language generated tends to be boring and predictable since it uses the most common words. Unique writers, on the other hand, use uncommon words to make their content stand out. He suggests that to make their social media more engaging, companies should train their own language model instead of relying solely on GPT-3. This would enable them to create content that is based on their language and incorporates unique words from different team members.

Jason emphasizes the importance of letting personality flourish in content creation but within the framework of the company's brand voice. He recalls advising Kristine, one of his team members, to express her personality in her writing while staying within the Kalicube brand voice. By training their language model and incorporating unique words from different team members, companies can create engaging content that reflects their brand's personality and stands out from the competition.

In conclusion, using unique words in content creation is crucial to differentiate oneself from the competition. While GPT-3 is a powerful language model, companies should consider training their own model to incorporate their brand's personality and voice into their content. This approach allows for more creative freedom while staying true to the company's values and brand image.","Jason Barnard points out that experts often utilize a more diverse vocabulary as compared to non-experts. Yet, when relying on GPT-3 for content generation, the outcome may seem monotonous and overly generic due to the prevalence of commonly used words. Divergently, unique writers often make use of less frequently used words, thus making their content more vibrant and distinctive.

He further proposes that, instead of solely leaning on GPT-3, businesses should construct their own language model for enhanced social media engagement. By doing so, they can generate content that is distinctly embedded with their business language and enriched by the unique terminologies used by various team members.

Jason underscores the necessity of giving personality ample room to thrive in content creation, albeit within the confines of the company's overarching brand voice. He recounts guiding Kristine, a member of his team, to infuse her writing with her individual personality, while concurrently adhering to the Kalicube brand voice.

By pumping their own language model with unique vocabulary derived from their team members, businesses can craft engaging and differentiated content that not only sparkles with their brand's personality but also garners distinction from competitors.

Summing up, the usage of unique words is instrumental in setting a brand's content apart from its competitors. Despite GPT-3's formidable capabilities as a language model, businesses should contemplate constructing their own model in order to infuse their brand personality and voice into their content. This strategy fosters greater creativity yet ensures consistency with the company's ethical values and brand perception.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:54:30

This information is found in the Knowledge Graph. Currently, only larger brands with a Wikipedia page typically have a presence in the Knowledge Graph. However, this is rapidly changing and more brands are gaining a place in the Knowledge Graph without a Wikipedia page.

To gain a presence in the Knowledge Panel, you need to ensure that Google is confident in its understanding of your brand. Start by adding Schema.org markup to your About Us page, then reinforce the information by having at least 20 trustworthy and relevant external sources validate it. This approach, referred to as trust-based knowledge by Xin Luna Dong, is critical in gaining Google's acceptance of information as fact. Google considers information to be knowledge only when it has been confirmed by multiple trusted sources.","Jason Barnard points out that Google must have a comprehensive understanding of your brand aspects, derived from the Knowledge Graph, in order to display your brand's information in the Knowledge Panel. Traditionally, larger brands with a Wikipedia page have tended to get a spot in the Knowledge Graph, but the trend is quickly evolving to include brands without a Wikipedia page. To solidify your brand's identity in the Knowledge Panel, one strategic approach is to use Schema.org markup on your 'About Us' page while ensuring that your brand's information is validated by at least 20 credible and relevant external resources. Xin Luna Dong highlights this framework, known as 'trust-based knowledge,"" as an important way to get confirmation from Google that your brand's information is factual.

However, YouTube is more commonly used, not because it is a Google platform, but because it has better search engine optimization. For a video to appear on a brand's SERP, it must be relevant, and Google has an algorithm that places a relevant video there. The video can be hosted on Facebook, Vimeo, or YouTube, but the content must be relevant, as determined by the Google video bot. To improve the chances of a video appearing on a brand's SERP, it is important to regularly release videos with good engagement metrics that are relevant to the brand. Jason Barnard prefers to publish videos on YouTube because it is simple, has a large pool of potential users, and has built-in search engine optimization friendly to Google.","Jason Barnard points out that regularly posting engaging and relevant video content plays a critical role in expanding your online presence and improving your Brand SERP. Although Google can source videos from platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo, YouTube is usually the platform of choice. This isn't only because it's a Google-owned platform, but more importantly because of its excellent SEO features. The key to improving your brand's visibility in the SERPs lies in the relevance of the video content. Google uses an algorithm that strategically places relevant videos on your Brand SERP. To increase the chances of your videos appearing in prominent positions, you should focus on creating and regularly publishing content that generates high engagement and is relevant to your brand. Due to its simplicity, large viewership, and Google-friendly SEO features, YouTube is often the preferred platform for brand videos.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

You might think that ranking first for your brand name or personal name means the job is done, but in reality, the Knowledge Panel is a summary of the facts that Google has understood about you. Google faces a problem in that it has many different pieces of information about you scattered around the internet, on places like Facebook, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or even in an article about you in the New York Times. It is trying to piece all of these scattered bits of information together to create a complete picture of who you are, what you do, and who your audience is.","Jason Barnard points out that the core of Google's understanding of your website is your homepage and your sitelinks. Achieving a top ranking for your brand or personal name may seem like a successful endeavour, but it's actually the content of the Knowledge Panel that is a summary of the facts Google has determined about you. Google faces the challenge of sifting through a wealth of information about you scattered all over the Internet ? on platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, or even in a New York Times article about you.

674,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/brand-serps-talks/how-to-dominate-the-serps-for-your-brand-name-with-jason-barnard/,The Importance of Entity Home and How It Affects Your Knowledge Panel,"According to Jason Barnard, a crucial aspect of SEO strategy involves educating Google about who you are, what you do, who your audience is, and why you might be a great solution for them. He emphasizes that this concept applies not only to Knowledge Panels and the Knowledge Graph but to the entire SEO approach. Jason believes that by presenting a complete picture of your brand to the algorithm through the Entity Home, you can convince the robot that your website is the correct one to compare fragmented bits to, leading to the creation of a Knowledge Panel.

To explain why the Entity Home is essential in this process, Jason draws on an analogy proposed by John Mueller of Google: reconciliation. Mueller believes that the machine has scattered information about a brand around the web, but it cannot piece it together. In contrast, Jason compares the scattered information to a shattered china plate that the machine must glue back together. By presenting the algorithm with the complete plate through the Entity Home, you can persuade it that your website is the correct one to compare the fragmented bits to, leading to the creation of a Knowledge Panel.

Overall, Jason believes that the key to a successful SEO strategy is to present a clear and complete picture of your brand to the algorithm through the Entity Home. By doing so, you can help the algorithm piece together the scattered information about your brand and create a Knowledge Panel that accurately represents your brand to potential customers.","Jason Barnard posits that educating Google about your identity, activities, target audience, and the reasons your brand could be an ideal solution for them, is a crucial part of SEO strategy. This applies to not just Knowledge Panels and the Knowledge Graph, but the entirety of the SEO approach. According to Jason, by providing a comprehensive depiction of your brand to the algorithm via the Entity Home, you can convince the machine that your website is the appropriate reference when comparing disparate bits of information, setting the stage for a Knowledge Panel's creation. Jason explains the significance of the Entity Home by referring to an analogy offered by John Mueller from Google, termed ""reconciliation."" Mueller asserts that the algorithm has access to widespread details about a brand across the internet, but lacks the capability to connect the dots. Conversely, Jason likens the dispersed information to a broken china plate, which the machine is tasked to reassemble. By supplying the algorithm with a complete plate, symbolized by the Entity Home, you can persuade it that your website is the correct reference to compare the fragmented pieces to, thereby facilitating the creation of a Knowledge Panel. In summation, Jason contends that the secret to a successful SEO strategy lies in presenting an unambiguous and holistic picture of your brand to the algorithm via the Entity Home. Subsequently, this aids the algorithm in assembling disparate pieces of information about your brand and generates a Knowledge Panel that accurately portrays your brand to potential clientele.",2,17,2023-03-23 08:17:07

While some people feel like they have accomplished something by having their page on the site, it is a crowdsourced platform and may not necessarily be true or accurate. Jason Barnard argues that it is not for Wikipedia to judge what someone has achieved. He notes that Rand Fishkin made a similar point in his podcast. While Wikipedia may be accurate when it comes to specific details like what happened in a particular episode of a TV show, it often gets details about people and companies wrong.

Jason Barnard believes that Wikipedia can be a dangerous area to get involved in if you do not have knowledge of the people who run it. This is because the information on the site can be misleading or incorrect, especially when it comes to people and businesses. While some people may feel a sense of pride in being listed on Wikipedia, it is important to recognize that it is not always a reliable source of information. Instead of relying on crowdsourced platforms like Wikipedia, it may be better to focus on building a strong personal brand through other means, such as social media, content creation, and building relationships with customers and clients.","Jason Barnard posits that the feeling of success attained from a Wikipedia listing may be misleading. Despite the sense of validation some people get from being featured on the platform, one should realize that it is a crowdsourced site and may contain inaccurate or false information. It isn't Wikipedia's role, Barnard contends, to validate someone's achievements. Echoing a statement made by Rand Fishkin during his podcast, he claims that although Wikipedia might be spot-on with certain facts, for example specifics regarding a TV show episode, it can be inaccurate when referencing individuals or companies. Involvement with Wikipedia, Barnard suggests, could lead to complications if the individuals operating it are not well-known to you, as information on the site could misrepresent or misconstrue the truth about people and businesses. While the pride felt by some from a Wikipedia listing may seem significant, it's crucial to apprehend the platform's lack of reliability. It might be worthier to cultivate a robust personal brand through alternative means such as social media, generating content, and fostering relationships with clientele, rather than depending on crowdsourced platforms like Wikipedia.",2,17,2023-02-20 08:50:07

While some may prioritize ranking for popular keywords, it's important to focus on converting and retaining those who search for the brand name, despite the lack of immediate return on investment. The Brand SERP provides insight into audience perception and content strategy, as Google ranks the most valuable and helpful content for a brand's audience.

By analyzing the Brand SERP, a brand can identify potential issues with their audience, such as negative reviews, and adjust their content strategy accordingly. The Brand SERP also serves as a reflection of what Google and the world think about a brand, providing a useful tool for introspection. While prioritizing the brand name audience may be difficult to quantify in terms of return on investment, it is a crucial aspect of client acquisition and retention.","Jason Barnard posits that the paramount audience for any brand, the individuals who search for their brand name, play a vital role in the augmentation and retention of the client base. Although some might emphasize the significance of ranking for prevalent keywords, it's essential to concentrate on capturing and maintaining those who proactively search for the brand name?even if the immediate return on investment isn't apparent. The Brand SERP provides a mirror into how an audience perceives a brand and suggests an effective content strategy, as Google prioritizes content it deems most beneficial and relevant for a brand's audience. Through an analysis of the Brand SERP, a brand can pinpoint potential areas of concern with its audience (for example, negative reviews) and revise their content strategy accordingly. The Brand SERP is also a manifestation of both Google's and the global perception of a brand, thereby serving as an effective tool for self-assessment. Despite the fact that prioritizing the audience linked with the brand name might be challenging to measure in terms of return on investment, it is an indispensable aspect in acquiring and retaining clients.",2,17,2023-02-16 10:10:21

Google's algorithm is designed to identify the most efficient and effective solution to the user's query. Therefore, it is essential for businesses to ensure that Google understands their website as a solution to the problem or question that users are searching for.

Although many businesses focus on targeting users who are looking for specific keywords, Jason notes that businesses often need to educate users and bring them down the funnel to understand the need for their product or service. This process of educating the user and bringing them closer to making a purchase or taking action necessarily ends in a brand search. When a user performs a brand search, their perception of the brand is formed by the information presented on the Google Business Card. The Google Business Card can tilt a user's perception of a brand towards a positive or negative decision.

In summary, the search engine results page is designed to efficiently provide solutions and answers to users' queries, and businesses need to ensure that Google understands their website as a solution. Educating users and bringing them down the funnel can lead to a brand search, and the information presented on the Google Business Card can significantly impact the user's perception of the brand.","Jason Barnard posits that the purpose of search engine results pages on platforms like Google and Bing is to swiftly present users with accurate answers to their queries or the best solutions to their problems. Google's algorithm is specifically engineered to pinpoint the most effective and rapid solution fitting the user's search. Hence, it's crucial for businesses to align their site content in a manner that Google perceives it as an answer to the user inquiries. Despite the common strategy of many businesses to chase specific keyword rankings, Jason suggests that a broader approach is needed. Businesses often must guide users, educate them, and gradually direct them down the sales funnel until they comprehend the value of the company's products or services. This comprehensive education process normally culminates in a brand search. The information displayed on the company's Google Business Card during this brand search significantly influences the users' perception of the brand and ultimately can lean their decision in a positive or negative direction. Summarily, though search engine results pages aim to supply efficient and accurate solutions to user queries, it's incumbent on businesses to position themselves as the ideal solution via Google's understanding. Through thorough customer education and consequent brand searches, a company's Google Business Card holds substantial sway in impacting a user's impression of the brand.",2,17,2023-02-28 08:06:06

This is because users trust Google to provide good search results, even if they may sometimes complain about it. Therefore, the Google Business Card is a stamp of approval from Google that is incredibly important to businesses, especially when it comes to converting bottom or post-funnel users.

The Google Business Card is especially important for businesses because the people searching for the brand name are often on the cusp of converting or are already a client. Thus, it is essential to ensure that the information on the Google Business Card is accurate and relevant to improve the user experience and increase the chances of conversion. In summary, the Google Business Card is a crucial aspect of a brand's online presence and should be optimized to ensure that it provides the best user experience for potential and existing clients.","Jason Barnard postulates that when users conduct a search for a brand, the Google Business Card displayed on the search results page is akin to an endorsement from Google. This stems from the fact that users place a high degree of trust in Google to deliver quality search results, despite occasional complaints. As such, the Google Business Card acts as a significant seal of approval from Google, which is of crucial importance to businesses, specifically when it comes to converting users at the bottom or post purchase funnel. The Google Business Card holds a particular significance for businesses, considering that individuals searching for the brand name are often on the verge of converting or are already clients. Therefore, it's of utmost necessity to ascertain the accuracy and relevancy of the information on the Google Business Card to enhance user experience and amplify conversion probabilities. In a nutshell, the Google Business Card is an invaluable component of a brand's digital footprint and its optimization is imperative to ensure it offers an optimal user experience to prospective and existing clients.",2,17,2023-03-01 05:24:33

The plugin sets up the basic things Google requires to access a website, such as understanding the structure and location of pages. Jono Alderson, who works for Yoast, has also added Schema Markup, which provides a machine-readable representation of the content on a webpage, making it easier for Google to understand. Jason believes this relieves website owners and SEOs from some of the burdens of managing a website.

Jason also notes that Yoast allows users to personalize the title and description of each webpage, which is what Google displays on the search engine results page. Yoast provides a suggested title and description, which is already better than what Google would suggest. However, users can further optimize the title and description to accurately represent the webpage. Jason compares Yoast to taking users to level 4 in terms of website optimization, but users can advance to higher levels depending on their skills, enthusiasm, and available time.","Jason Barnard praises Yoast as a useful tool that handles numerous tasks automatically upon installation. Yoast configures myriad basic elements that Google needs to access and navigate a website, such as page structure and location. The addition of Schema Markup by Jono Alderson, an employee at Yoast, is highlighted by Jason, as it offers a machine-readable depiction of webpage content, simplifying Google's comprehension process. This attribute, according to Jason, alleviates the workload of both website owners and SEO professionals. In addition to these, Jason points out that Yoast allows users to customize webpage titles and descriptions that appear in Google's search engine results page. Even though Yoast offers a suggested title and description, which is an improvement from the default Google suggestion, users have the option to optimize them further to better embody the webpage. Jason likens the use of Yoast to achieving a level 4 in website optimization, with the potential for users to elevate to higher levels based on their proficiency, eagerness, and availability.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:06:06

One solution is to add a middle name or initial and start using it consistently so people can easily identify and search for you. For example, instead of searching for ""Ian Gray,"" which may result in a messy search engine results page, Jason would search for ""Ian Anderson Gray"" to find Ian more easily.

Another solution is to attach yourself to what you do or specialize in. For instance, if you are named Simon Cox and have a common name, you can pitch yourself as ""Simon Cox SEO"" to help Google identify you and present more accurate search results. This is important because when Google encounters ambiguity in search queries, it presents the most relevant options based on what it understands best. By making yourself less ambiguous, you can improve your search engine results and make it easier for people to find you online.","Jason Barnard presents several strategies for individuals who have a common name to differentiate themselves within search results. One approach is consistently using a middle name or initial, thereby making it easier for people to distinguish your online presence. For instance, utilizing ""Ian Anderson Gray"" instead of ""Ian Gray"" to introduce himself yields clearer search engine results. Another method is to align your name with your profession or specialization. For example, presenting oneself as ""Simon Cox SEO"" can help Google distinguish you and offer more precise search results, if your name is a common one like Simon Cox. This strategy is crucial because Google, faced with ambiguity in search queries, returns results it deems most relevant based on its understanding.

He notes that the restaurant has a strong online presence, with a local restaurant page and main website appearing at the top of the search results, along with positive reviews on Google and OpenTable.

However, Jason highlights an interesting feature of The Brand SERP: two questions about the restaurant appear prominently in the search results, with direct answers provided by Google. While these questions may not seem significant on the page itself, their visibility on The Brand SERP can impact a potential customer's perception of the restaurant.

Jason's takeaway from this analysis is that businesses should be aware of all mentions of their brand on third-party sites, as seemingly small details can be lifted and presented in a prominent manner on The Brand SERP. Overall, the analysis serves as a reminder of the importance of managing one's online presence and reputation in today's digital age.","Jason Barnard probes into The Brand SERP for Ruth's Chris, an upscale chain of American steak houses. He observes that the restaurant demonstrates a strong digital footprint, with its local restaurant page and core website surfacing at the top of search results along with positive assessments on Google and OpenTable. Yet, Jason brings attention to an intriguing aspect of The Brand SERP: the prominence of a pair of queries about the restaurant, with Google providing direct answers. Although these queries may seem inconsequential within the page context, their display on The Brand SERP could sway a prospective customer's viewpoint of the restaurant.

This approach involves creating content that is useful and valuable for the audience in the context of that platform. The content can then be repurposed for the brand's website and packaged for search engines like Google.

Jason provides the example of creating content for YouTube with specific timings that can be clicked on for more information. The video is then transcribed for the brand's website, providing added value for users and making it easier for Google to understand the content. This approach allows for a tailored user experience on both YouTube and the brand's website.","Jason Barnard promotes a content strategy that zeros in on generating content for platforms where the audience already congregates, such as social media outlets, online forums, and third-party sites. This tactic involves crafting content that is both valuable and pertinent to the audience considering the specifics of that platform. This content can subsequently be repurposed for use on the brand's own website and reworked to appeal to search engines like Google. Jason illustrates this approach with the example of producing content for YouTube with precise timings that function as navigational cues. The video content is then transcribed for the brand's website, enriching the user experience and facilitating Google's comprehension of the content. This methodology paves the way for a bespoke user experience on both YouTube and the brand's website.",2,17,2023-04-04 13:15:29

This is because it reflects what Google thinks the world thinks about your brand, which is important because Google's analysis is done on a much larger scale than any marketing company could achieve. Jason suggests that this is a better measurement than any other because while Google may not always be correct, it provides a starting point for understanding how your brand is perceived. Furthermore, if you disagree with Google's perception of your brand, it's your responsibility to explain and educate Google to correct any misconceptions.","Jason Barnard proposes that a simple Google search for your brand name and a review of the first hundred results offer valuable insights into your digital ecosystem. He asserts that this reflection signifies Google's perception of global viewpoints about your brand?something it accomplishes on a far larger scale than any marketing agency could. Jason posits this as a superior metric, as even though Google may not always be precise, it still establishes a baseline for gauging your brand's perception. Importantly, should you feel that Google's understanding of your brand is flawed, it becomes incumbent upon you to enlighten Google and rectify any misperceptions.",2,17,2023-02-27 06:26:04

The machine is being given specific instructions on the desired outcome and the ingredients to achieve that result. The machine then figures out the most efficient way to achieve that outcome under various circumstances.

Jason also notes that Google and other big tech companies are using machine learning, not artificial intelligence. The goal of machine learning is to perform a specific task more efficiently than a human would, rather than attempting to mimic human intelligence. While unexpected outcomes may still occur, the aim is to continually improve the machine's ability to perform a given task.","Jason Barnard proposes that despite the unsettling idea of machines ruling, it's crucial to remember that engineers are still at the helm. The machine is provided with explicit directions on the target result and the components required to attain this outcome. The machine then determines the most resourceful method to accomplish this result under a variety of conditions. Jason also points out that corporations like Google and other tech behemoths employ machine learning as opposed to artificial intelligence. The primary objective of machine learning is to execute a particular function more effectively than a human would, rather than replicating human cognition. Although unforeseen results may occur, the target is to continually enhance the capacity of the machine to perform a predetermined task.",2,17,2023-03-01 04:39:44

Jason also emphasizes the importance of reviews for local businesses like Blacklist Coffee Roasters.

The Brand SERP displays the Google My Business information at the top, along with the website and Facebook profile of the cafe, which contains positive reviews and images. However, Jason highlights that the website of Good Day Cafe does not have an image identified in the HTML, which could potentially make their site stand out more on the SERP.

Jason suggests three ways that Good Day Cafe could easily get an image from their homepage onto the SERP to improve their branding. Firstly, they could use the OG value in the metas, which allows website owners to provide information about their website to social media platforms. Secondly, they could use the Twitter image value in the metas, which serves a similar purpose as the OG value but for Twitter. Lastly, they could use the schema markup primary image of the page, which is a structured data format that helps search engines understand the content of a web page.

By implementing these techniques, Good Day Cafe could potentially increase their visibility on the SERP and stand out from their competitors. Jason emphasizes the importance of optimizing The Brand SERP for businesses to effectively manage their online reputation and establish a strong brand presence.","Jason Barnard provides an insightful examination of the Brand SERP for Good Day Cafe, a local enterprise. The Brand SERP prominently features the cafe's Google My Business information, its website, and Facebook profile, which house positive reviews and visuals. However, Jason points out a missed opportunity in the cafe's website which lacks an image identified in the HTML, a feature that could potentially enhance the website's prominence on the SERP. Jason proposes a three-pronged solution to incorporate an image from the business's homepage onto their SERP, consequently fostering improved brand visibility. First off, they could utilize the meta's OG value, a tool that enables website owners to relay information about their website to social media channels. The second tactic involves capitalizing on the Twitter image value in the meta, which functions similarly to the OG value but is exclusive to Twitter. Lastly, deploying the schema markup's primary image of the page, a structured data form that assists search engines in deciphering webpage content, can prove constructive. By adopting these strategies, Good Day Cafe could potentially augment their SERP presence, gaining an edge over their competition.

However, he watched a few of his early videos recently and realized how much he has improved. Jason encourages people to get comfortable with themselves on screen and to understand that their first attempts may not be great. He believes that improvement will come gradually, and people may not even notice it until they look back at their earlier work and see how much they have progressed.

Jason advises people to focus on what they could have done better rather than what they did wrong, which can help them adopt a positive attitude towards self-improvement. He recommends watching recordings of yourself and analyzing how you can improve. Doing so helped him to learn and improve himself, and he believes there is no limit to how much better you can become.

Overall, Jason's advice is to embrace the learning process and to continuously strive to improve oneself. By doing so, people can become more comfortable on screen and develop their skills over time.","Jason Barnard recalls initiating his 300th video before the onset of COVID, candidly admitting that his initial attempts weren't particularly stellar.

He asserts that gradual improvement is inevitable and may only become apparent when juxtaposed against one's formative work. Instead of dwelling on shortcomings, Jason advises focusing on areas for improvement, fostering a positive mindset towards self-enhancement. He endorses reviewing one's recordings and conducting critical analyses to facilitate improvement.

He defines the term SERP as a search engine results page and emphasizes that what appears when your audience searches your brand name on Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Yandex, or any other search engine, is crucial since these people are close to your business and could potentially interact with you. He advises that brands should not forget Bing, as it is also an important search engine in certain areas.","Jason Barnard recognizes that using industry-specific terminology like 'SERP' can sometimes complicate the message for wider audiences. He explains that 'SERP' refers to the Search Engine Results Page ? this is what pops up when someone searches your brand name on any search engine including Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yandex. He stresses the importance of managing these results, as they are often viewed by individuals already interested in your business and potentially on the verge of engagement.

877,Transcript,,Simplifying Page Structure to Help Bots Annotate Your Content,"Jason Barnard advises to use every technique possible to help bots understand and annotate your content. The structure of the page is important to bots as they need to know what is an image, what is a text, etc. Bots may not understand the page's structure if, for example, an image is gray on one page and green on another. It is important to keep consistency to avoid confusion in the bot's understanding of the page.

Jason also emphasizes the importance of simplifying the understanding of the page's content in the bot's head. If a bot sees a green image, it must assume that there is something different about it compared to the gray images it saw on other pages. This causes the bot to ask unnecessary questions which can lead to incorrect assumptions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the bot's understanding of the page's content is as simple and clear as possible.","Jason Barnard recommends using all available techniques to improve bots' understanding and commenting on your content. Website configuration is critical, as bots need to distinguish between different elements such as text and images. Inconsistent structuring, such as displaying an image in gray on one page and in green on another, could make it difficult for the bot to understand. Maintaining consistency is important to avoid distorting the bots' interpretation of the webpage.

Jason also stresses the importance of demystifying the content of the web page for bots. If a bot comes across an element it is unfamiliar with, such as a green image, and has previously only recognized gray images, it may conclude that the green image has unique properties. This can lead to the bot asking unnecessary questions and possibly making incorrect assumptions. Therefore, it is important that the bot understands the content of the web page simply and clearly.",2,17,2023-04-01 12:39:05

He had a problem, he could not update the content, and they promised the kids that every month on the first of the month they would put that content online. They would offer a song, an activity, an animation, and two games. Every first of the month, Jason would be up all night on the 31st or last day of the month to create this content and put it online, because kids do not forgive.

According to Jason, this consistency has led them to go from zero to 5 million visits per month to the site, a hundred million page views from kids. And that's with eight years of consistency. Every month on the first of the month, they produced that content, and kids knew it was going to be there. Jason points out that consistency is absolutely ""king"".

He explains that he was a cartoon blue dog pitching for work as an SEO in 2012, but he was not getting as much work as he thought he would. After meetings with potential clients, he realized they were Googling his name, and the top result was ""Jason Barnard is a cartoon blue dog,"" which was not helpful for his career as a digital marketer. He understood that he needed to educate Google about his current work and what his audience would be interested in seeing. This realization led him to work on optimizing his Brand SERP, which took him three months to sort out. Ten years later, he is still learning and working on it.

He believes that everyone who owns a business or wants to create a positive brand image should work on optimizing their Brand SERP. He emphasizes that Google evolves constantly, and it is an ongoing monthly task that requires a few hours of work to maintain. He encourages people to make sure that when someone Googles their name or business, they see positive, accurate, and convincing results that represent the brand message they want to convey.","Jason Barnard recounts the journey that led him to recognize the essential role of Brand SERP and inspired his book.

He uses The Dictionary Hostel in London as an example and highlights the potential implications of this change. According to Jason, this shift suggests that Google is taking back control from businesses, and will begin pushing out more information that businesses do not control. This is evidenced by the placement of ads in the middle of the business panel, which takes business away from the company. While the change may seem subtle, Jason argues that it is very meaningful and important for businesses to pay attention to.","Jason Barnard reflects on the recent transition from Google My Business to Google Business Profile and what it could spell for businesses. Through the lens of The Dictionary Hostel in London, he explores the possible repercussions of this modification. In Jason's view, this alteration implies Google is reclaiming influence from companies, and planning to divulge more uncontrolled information. The inclusion of ads within the business panel that diverts business serves as a testament to this.

Jason Barnard realized that it was very labor-intensive, and after a day, Kalicube had collected around 50 profile pages and review platforms.

To automate the process, Jason Barnard built a SaaS platform, Kalicube Pro. Now, it takes only two minutes for Kalicube to build the entire digital ecosystem, including all the profiles, review platforms, and other sites that are discussing a company. Kalicube can prioritize the sources based on how important Google considers them, and the user can click on each source to correct it.","Jason Barnard revealed that he was previously employed at Yoast, the renowned WordPress plugin company, where he was primarily involved in improving the Knowledge Panel.

Jason observes that Farro's official site isn't shown on the first page of Google's search results, but can be found on the second page, where it doesn't rank well due to a lack of content.

Jason advises Farro to add more information and written content to his official site so that Google can better rank it and show it on the first page, which would also improve the user experience for fans who want to access his site. Interestingly, in the UK, where Farro is less famous and there is less competition, his official site does rank on the first page, even though it has no content. Therefore, he encourages Farro to focus on improving the content of his site to boost his rankings and presence on Google's brand SERP.","Jason Barnard reviews the brand SERP of musician Zack Farro.

Jason recommends that Farro populate his official site with more informative textual content to enhance its Google ranking and ease its accessibility to fans. Intriguingly, in the UK where Farro is less renowned and faces lesser competition, his official site takes a spot on the first search results page despite its content deficiency.

Jason notes that this is the only search result where McCool has provided information about himself, while the rest of the results are from Wikipedia or other individuals with the same name.

Jason emphasizes that Google is collecting a lot of information about McCool and displaying it to its users, regardless of his preference for privacy. He suggests that public figures should take control of their online information as much as possible by creating a website where they can provide accurate information about themselves, which Google can then verify with other sources. By doing so, public figures can ensure that the information presented when their name is searched is accurate and from a reliable source.","Jason Barnard scrutinises the Brand SERP for Robert McCool, the creator of the first Apache HTTP server and a notable figure in the internet realm.

Jason emphasises that despite McCool's predilection for seclusion, Google is aggregating significant amounts of information about him and making them accessible to its users. He advocates that personalities exposed to the public eye should actively manage their online presence by setting up a personal website.

Jason suggests that Alexandra needs to create content on authoritative sources that highlight her career and existence outside of her relationship with Sean Parker.

By doing so, she can influence the subtitle on her Google Knowledge Panel and detach herself from the explicit reference to her marriage.

On the right-hand side of the SERP, the Knowledge Panel contains lots of useful information and relevant People Also Search For suggestions.

However, one major issue with Bonhams' Brand SERP is the lack of a description or title for their home page. Google is struggling to find text to use as a snippet, and although Bonhams' website has clean and optimized source code, it doesn't include a meta title or description. As a result, Google is only able to show the brand name and nothing else when users search for Bonhams.

To improve their Brand SERP, Bonhams should provide Google with a meta title and description or, ideally, some content on the homepage that Google can use to better represent the company. This will give Google a better understanding of what Bonhams offers and will help the company stand out more in the search results.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes Bonhams' Brand SERP, a brand known for its auction house and valuation service. He recognises the quality Brand SERP of Bonhams, visually enriched with diverse and relevant sitelinks such as Twitter, Wikipedia, Facebook, and a review site, invaluable.com. The presence of pertinent People Also Search For suggestions and vast useful information in the Knowledge Panel situated on the SERP's right-hand side is commendable. Nonetheless, Bonhams' Brand SERP encounters a significant challenge? the glaring absence of a title or description for their home page. Consequently, Google struggles to locate suitable text for a snippet. Despite the website's clean and streamlined source code, it lacks a meta title and description, leading to Google only displaying the brand name, and no additional content when users search for Bonhams. To enhance their Brand SERP, Bonhams ought to feed Google with a convincing meta title and description or preferably, incorporate some content on their homepage. This strategy will provide Google with a lucid comprehension of what Bonhams does, boosting their prominence in search results.",2,17,2023-02-20 11:01:46

He Should Move it to a Site he Controls,"Jason Barnard points out some interesting features, including the fact that searching for The Rock brings up results for Dwayne Johnson. Jason notes that Johnson has a very rich right-rail, which includes information about his movies and his presence on the platform Cameo, where he answers questions from his fans. However, he also points out that Johnson's Entity Home is currently Facebook, which is not ideal because it is not a site that he owns or controls completely.

Jason suggests that Johnson should create a one-page website that represents him and communicates with his audience. By doing so, Johnson could take control of his online presence and educate Google on where his primary online presence is. This is important because the source that Google trusts for information about Johnson is currently Facebook, but having a personal website would give Johnson more control over the information that is presented to those searching for him online.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes some compelling aspects during a search for The Rock, which unsurprisingly yields results for Dwayne Johnson. Barnard remarks on Johnson's comprehensive right-panel, which encompasses data about his movies as well as his involvement on Cameo, a platform where he addresses fan queries. Nonetheless, he also observes that the main platform reflecting Johnson's online entity currently is Facebook, a platform Johnson neither owns nor entirely controls. Barnard advises that Johnson could benefit from establishing a one-page website, serving as a personalized representation of himself communicating with his fan base. This would enable Johnson to gain command over his digital identity and indicate to Google his primary online locality. As of now, Facebook is the source Google relies on for information on Johnson. However, owning a personal website would give Johnson greater influence over the details presented to internet users searching for him.",2,17,2023-03-21 08:01:35

The Rich Sitelinks show that the company has multiple outlets in the country, but the focus is on the People Also Ask section. While Big Motoring World does dominate the first result for the question ""Can you haggle with Big Motoring World?"", Jason notes that the answer is buried within a long list of FAQs and is not easily accessible for users.

Jason advises against using accordion-style systems for FAQs on a company's website or for users coming in from Google for answers to questions about the brand. He recommends having one question-answer per page for a better user experience. This would make it easier for users to find the answer they are looking for without having to search through a long list of questions and answers.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for Big Motoring World, a UK-based car dealership. While the Rich Sitelinks highlight its numerous locations around the country, Jason's attention is drawn to the People Also Ask section. In this section, Big Motoring World dominates the top spot with the question ""Can you haggle with Big Motoring World?"", but the response is nestled within an extensive FAQ list, making it less user-friendly. Jason discourages the use of accordion systems for FAQs on a brand's website, especially for users visiting via Google in search of specific answers. Instead, he suggests implementing a one-question-per-page layout, drastically improving the user experience. This approach will facilitate users in easily locating the specifically sought answer without the need to sift through a hefty compilation of questions and answers.",2,17,2023-02-20 10:41:19

While commenting on the typical sports person's Brand SERP with lots of information about the athlete, Jason highlights a feature that caught his attention - the People Also Ask section. He notes that instead of providing a short answer with a link to an external site, Google is now providing the answer directly with a link to its own SERPs. This is significant because it shows that for simple questions like this, Google is now answering them itself, and opportunities for sites to control the information presented in these answer boxes will likely decrease over time. Therefore, it is essential for businesses to start educating Google to ensure that the information displayed is correct, accurate, and helpful to their audience when searching their brand name.

As a result, Jason advises that businesses should take steps to educate Google on their brand and the information that should be presented. By doing so, they can increase the likelihood of Google presenting accurate and helpful information in the People Also Ask and Answer Box sections. This will improve the user experience for individuals searching for information related to their brand, and potentially lead to increased website traffic and engagement.

Overall, Jason's video highlights the importance of monitoring and optimizing a Brand's SERP to ensure that accurate and helpful information is presented. As Google's algorithm continues to evolve and the answer boxes become more prevalent, it is crucial for businesses to take control of their online presence by educating Google and providing relevant, high-quality content.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for Casey DeSmith, a professional ice hockey goaltender. As he navigates through the athlete's Brand SERP, loaded with abundant information, Jason points out an intriguing feature in the People Also Ask section. He observes that Google directly delivers answers, providing a link leading back to its SERPs rather than an external site. This is a noteworthy change as it indicates Google is self-governing the answers to straightforward inquiries. Consequently, Jason predicts a decrease in opportunities for websites to dominate responses in these answer boxes. Therefore, he underscores the importance for businesses to instruct Google to ensure the display of correct and beneficial information to their audience during brand name searches. Jason advocates for brands actively informing Google about their information and content that should be displayed. By doing so, brands can enhance the chances of Google offering precise and beneficial details in the People Also Ask and Answer Box sections. This will uplift the user experience for individuals seeking information related to a brand, potentially boosting website traffic and engagement.

He notes that Shatner has a very rich Knowledge Panel, which includes information on his marriages, children, movies, TV shows, and music albums, and provides a lot of people also search for suggestions. He explains that the Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel have remained fairly consistent over the last five years until recently, when Shatner went to space. On that day, Google adapted the Brand SERP to breaking news and moved top stories and videos to the top of the page, while relegating his Twitter Boxes, Wikipedia page, and TV and music career information to halfway down the page. However, the Brand SERP reverted to its normal state in the following days.

Jason highlights that Google is very sensitive to breaking news and will adapt a Brand SERP accordingly when it feels that it is helpful and valuable to the audience searching that person or brand name. He suggests that brands and individuals should be aware of this and take advantage of it when possible to optimize their online presence.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for famed actor William Shatner, observing that his Knowledge Panel is notably comprehensive. It encompasses details about his marital history, offspring, film and television roles, music albums, and provides a substantial number of people also search for suggestions. Jason emphasizes that Shatner's Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel have stayed relatively stable over the past five years, with a significant shift occurring only recently when Shatner embarked on a space travel. During that period, Google promptly updated the Brand SERP to prioritize breaking news, promoting top stories and videos to the forefront, while moving his Twitter boxes, Wikipedia content, and information about his TV and music career further down. Notably, Google soon reverted the Brand SERP back to its previous state in subsequent days. Jason emphasizes Google's acute responsiveness to current news events, noting its readiness to adjust a Brand SERP to cater to audience interest when browsing a specific individual or brand. Accordingly, he advises brands and individuals to remain mindful of this aspect of Google's functionality, leveraging it when feasible, to enhance their digital footprint.",2,17,2023-03-21 08:20:25

This ambiguity is reflected in the search results, with Google providing users with different options based on their search intent, such as local businesses, tips and tricks, and the definition of the word ""safari.""

In contrast, for browsers with more specific names like Firefox, the Brand SERP is more focused on the browser itself, with fewer distractions or options for other interpretations. This highlights the importance of having a clear and distinct brand name that reflects the nature of the business, as it can impact how Google presents the brand in search results and how potential customers perceive it.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for Safari, a browser bearing a name that carries multiple meanings. The resultant variety is apparent in search outcomes, with Google offering diverse options influenced by user search intent. These include local businesses, handy hints, and the meaning of ""safari."" On the other hand, when dealing with browsers like Firefox, which have unique names, the Brand SERP centers mainly on the browser, reducing distractions or potential for alternate interpretations. This underlines the value of a definitive and unique brand name that accurately signifies a business. This can significantly influence Google's presentation of the brand in search results and the way prospective clients perceive it.",2,17,2023-02-23 07:15:44

On the left-hand side of the page, there are Top Stories, People Also Ask, Wikipedia, Twitter and YouTube Feeds related to Will Smith. On the right-hand side, a small detail is highlighted where Cara Delevingne is trending. When one person is trending in terms of search volume, Google will tend to promote them to the top of the list for People Also Search For related entities. However, Jason notes that even though Will Smith is in Cara Delevingne's People Also Search For list, Cara Delevingne is not in Will Smith's list. Therefore, he warns that one cannot count on the reciprocal relationship between entities shown in each other's Knowledge Panels.

Jason emphasizes the importance of understanding how Google adapts to events worldwide, such as the 2021 Olympics, and the importance of having an Entity Home that individuals or brands own and control entirely. He also notes that Google's right-hand rail is keeping up to date with events on a minute-to-minute basis and that this is something that brands and people should pay close attention to in the years to come.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for the celebrity, Will Smith. Significant features on the left side of the page consist of Top Stories, People Also Ask, along with Wikipedia, Twitter, and YouTube feeds relevant to Smith. A minor yet noteworthy detail on the right-hand side reveals trending information on Cara Delevingne. Given a surge in an individual's search volume, Google tends to prioritize them on the 'People Also Search For' related entities' list. However, despite Smith appearing on Delevingne's list, Delevingne doesn't hold a spot on Smith's list. As such, Jason cautions against relying on the assumed bilateral relationships between entities displayed within their respective Knowledge Panels. He underlines the significance of grasping how Google reacts to international happenings, such as the 2021 Olympics, and the crucial nature of possessing an Entity Home, which is completely owned and managed by the individual or brand.

602,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/person/jonathan-franzen/,Jonathan Franzen?s Entity Home Disappears From his Knowledge Panel in Denmark,"Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP for American novelist Jonathan Franzen. The Brand SERP begins with book ads, followed by Franzen's Knowledge Panel, which contains various Filter Pills, indicating that the panel is focused on Franzen's works in New York and in English. Next, we see Franzen's Entity Home, his personal website, and Wikipedia, which provides extensive information about his works.

Moving on to the Danish version of the SERP, we notice that the ads for Franzen's books are still present, but there are fewer Filter Pills, as Google has insufficient Danish content to provide a more comprehensive selection. Interestingly, Franzen's Entity Home is absent from the Danish Knowledge Panel, even though his website still ranks in the search results. This is because Google prioritizes providing the best user experience for the searcher by displaying content in their preferred language.

Overall, Franzen's Brand SERP highlights the importance of language and location when it comes to Google's display of search results. While Franzen's Entity Home may not appear in all versions of his Brand SERP, he can still maintain a strong digital presence by optimizing his content for specific languages and regions.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for the popular American writer, Jonathan Franzen.

Franzen's Entity Home - his personal website - and Wikipedia, offer abundant information about his literary oeuvre. Transitioning to the Danish version of the Brand SERP, book ads persist, albeit with reduced Filter Pills, reflecting Google's restricted Danish content options. Intriguingly, the Danish Knowledge Panel lacks Franzen's Entity Home, though his site continues to rank in resultant findings.

Overall, Franzen's Brand SERP underscores the significance of language and geographical considerations in Google's presentation of search findings.

However, he notices that the values do not correspond to what Starbucks provides on their own website. This means that Google is not taking this information from Starbucks, and Jason wonders where they are getting this data from.

Jason believes that this shows how much detail Google is willing to provide for individual products over time, and how much they are willing to provide information that is not provided by the manufacturer or seller themselves. He encourages businesses to start building their internal knowledge graph and providing accurate information to Google.","Jason Barnard scrutinizes the Brand SERP for the renowned coffee company, Starbucks. His attention is caught by the 'menu nutrition' section on the right side of the page. Clicking on 'Java chip frappuccino' leads him to an extensive list of nutritional information.

This suggests that Google sources this information somewhere other than Starbucks, making Jason curious about the origin of this data. He views this as evidence of Google's dedication to providing extensive product-specific information over time, even when such details aren't supplied by the manufacturers or vendors themselves.

Jason explains that LinkedIn tends to promote individual profiles over company profiles because it wants to encourage businesses to spend advertising dollars.

He explains that every month for nine years, he and his wife released a new animation, song, two games, and a manual activity for kids that their parents could do with them. Jason was in charge of coding the games and spent the last night of each month testing and playing them over and over to ensure that they would work properly. He also tells a story about how they received mail by using the address ""between the sea and the post office, Mauritius.""

After returning to France and trying to sell himself as a digital marketer, Jason discovered that potential clients were Googling his name after meetings and finding his children's website. They concluded that he wasn't serious and chose not to work with him. In response, Jason worked on his own personal Brand SERP, which led to a significant increase in conversions. He went from converting 50% of the time to 80% of the time, and his prices were no longer questioned.","Jason Barnard shares his journey of developing a children's website named Boowa and Kwala. For nine years on a monthly basis, Jason and his wife would produce a new animation, a song, a pair of games, and do-it-yourself activities for children to tackle with their parents. Jason was tasked with the coding of the games, dedicating the final night of each month to rigorous testing and refining to ensure flawless functionality. He narrates an entertaining anecdote about how their correspondence at the address ""between the sea and the post office, Mauritius"" was successfully received. Upon his return to France, while trying to market himself as a digital marketer, Jason noticed that his prospective clientele were conducting Google searches of his name post-meeting and encountering his children's website. This led to their questioning of his seriousness, causing them to decline his services.

Then he joined a band and sang on many music albums, and he heard his voice so often that he learned to like it. Then he was a blue dog in a cartoon, and he didn't like his face, but he didn't need to see his face because he was just the voice, so that was okay. Then he started making videos 10 years ago, and he hated seeing himself. And he found that the more he did it, the more he felt comfortable with both the voice and the face, looking at himself and listening to himself.

The big problem for Jason was writing. He was very, very, very nervous about writing because he comes from a family of writers. So the bar was set very high, and he was convinced that he couldn't write. And he believes that we all have that problem when it comes to content creation. And he was fortunate enough to write for Search Engine Journal, for a guy named Danny Goodwin, who told him that he was overthinking it. He encouraged Jason, and he wrote. And now he thinks he's a pretty good writer.

And so Jason got to the point where he actually wrote a book. But it's about putting your mind to it, and having someone support you and say, ""This is better than you think,"" is incredibly valuable and helpful. And once you start doing that, it gets easier and easier. So it's that starting point that's really difficult. And the support that you get from people around you is incredibly important. And once you start, you do it week after week and it's easy as pie.","Jason Barnard shares his personal journey of embracing self-perception and content creation. Initially, he disliked his own voice but this changed when he joined a band and had to listen to his own voice frequently. Similarly, he disliked his face but didn't concern himself with it, as his primary role in a cartoon was as a voice actor. His discomfort extended to making videos but, over time, he started becoming more at ease with his voice and image. His biggest challenge, however, was writing; coming from a family of writers raised his self-imposed bar exceptionally high, which robbed him of confidence in his writing skills. Yet, with the right encouragement, notably from Danny Goodwin at Search Engine Journal, Jason began to write and eventually considered himself competent enough to author a book. Jason maintains that the initial steps into content creation can be daunting, with self-doubt acting as a significant hindrance. He champions the power of external validation and posits that consistent effort turns the seemingly intimidating task effortless over time.",2,17,2023-02-23 05:33:31

He emphasizes that fake link-building will not work, as Google has become more advanced over the years. However, building links to resources that are considered valuable and authoritative is a tactic that can be used from the outside.

Jason also discusses the importance of third-party references to one's brand and how they can be influenced. By contacting the person who wrote the article and potentially linking out to them from one's own site, it is possible to promote the idea to Google that one is an honest and authoritative reference about themselves. He stresses that by convincing Google that one is the most authoritative person about themselves, it is possible to point to these references and improve one's Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard shares insights on how link-building can enhance one's Brand SERP visibility. He makes it clear that artificial link-building won't yield the desired results, given Google's advanced algorithms. However, generating links to reputable and valuable resources from external sources can be an effective strategy. Jason further delves into the significance of external references to one's brand and how their perception can be modified. This can be achieved by reaching out to authors of articles and potentially creating outbound links to them from your site. Such actions can amplify to Google that you are a reliable and expert reference concerning yourself. Jason underlines that convincing Google that you are the most definitive authority about yourself can allow you to leverage such references, thus optimizing your Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-03-28 17:42:38

He highlights the importance of understanding user intent and providing accurate answers to queries. He explains that the back end of the answer engine equation involves search engines such as Google and Bing, which provide answers to users' queries. Meanwhile, the front end involves understanding what the user wants, what question they're asking, and what problem they're trying to solve. Jason also notes that while the slide only shows Google and Bing as the sources of information for the answers, voice assistants require additional sources of information.","Jason Barnard sheds light on how search engines have advanced and how voice assistants are coming to the fore. He accentuates the importance of comprehending user intent and delivering correct responses to users' searches. He elucidates that the answer engine infrastructure encompasses search engines like Google and Bing on one end, which cater to users' inquiries. On the other hand, the user-facing end involves deciphering the users' needs, the inquiries they are posing, and the challenges they are seeking to resolve.

Jason had advised him to take control of his Brand SERP, and he listened. Craig was able to get rid of the negative content in a week instead of six months because he had taken Jason's advice seriously.

Jason suggests that a Brand SERP with around seven to eight Blue Links and three Rich Elements is ideal. Rich Sitelinks are also important and make up 25% of the entire Brand SERP that businesses can control completely. Rich Sitelinks include not just the meta title and description of a business's Homepage, but also other pages about clients, podcasts, and content. He advises that if a business does not have Rich Sitelinks, they should look into technical issues like siloing or navigation and solve them to get better crawlability and make Google and the business happy.

Jason also suggests that having good content is essential for businesses to get Rich Sitelinks. He explains that Google sometimes summarizes and changes a business's title, which can lead to confusion, such as Joe Biden's meta title being ""vice president of the United States"" when he was actually the president. Jason recommends using semantic HTML5 and Schema Markup for pages like the Homepage, Contact Page, About Page, Profile Page, Pricing, and Blog. According to Jason, using semantic HTML5 well can help businesses get rewarded in the Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard states that both Blue Links and Rich Elements, like Video Boxes, Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes, and People Also Ask Boxes, contribute significantly to a Brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Contrary to the belief that Blue Links are phasing out, he emphasizes their enduring relevance, suggesting an optimal SERP should comprise around seven to eight Blue Links and three Rich Elements. He also champions the importance of Rich Sitelinks, which account for approximately 25% of an entire Brand SERP. Unlike the typical meta title and description confined to a business's Homepage, Rich Sitelinks extend to feature additional pages about clients, podcasts, and other content. Jason advises firms lacking Rich Sitelinks to investigate potential technical issues, such as siloing or poor navigation. Tackling these can increase crawlability, pleasing both Google and the business itself. He further underlines the need for high-quality content to secure Rich Sitelinks. Jason cautions that Google can occasionally modify a business's title summary, leading to potential misunderstandings - citing Joe Biden's meta title appearing as ""vice president of the United States"" during his presidency as an example. To avoid such confusion, he advocates for the use of semantic HTML5 and Schema Markup, especially for pages like the Homepage, Contact Page, About Page, Profile Page, Pricing, and Blog. In Jason's view, businesses can expect to see their Brand SERP performance rewarded for their effective use of semantic HTML5.",2,17,2023-03-23 17:20:15

Rather, website owners must work to educate Google about who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. He believes that starting with the Brand SERP is crucial in SEO because if it is done right, Google will understand the brand and increase the chances of being shown as the most suitable solution to its users' problems.

Jason also advises looking at the sitelinks that appear in the Brand SERP. These links are the pages on a site that Google thinks are interesting for the audience. If these sitelinks are not accurate, it means that Google has misunderstood the site's structure, content, or purpose. He suggests using techniques such as site structure, grouping pages by topic and theme, and building the site in a different way to educate Google and ensure that the sitelinks accurately reflect the site's content.","Jason Barnard states that it is not possible to instruct Google not to index a website's pages. Instead, he advises website owners to inform Google about their identity, activities, and target audience. Concentrating on the Brand SERP is critical in SEO, according to Jason, as this method can enhance Google's understanding of a brand, thereby increasing the possibility of the brand being displayed as the most apt solution for a user's query. Jason also suggests evaluating the sitelinks that show up in the Brand SERP. These are the website's pages that Google deems interesting for the audience. If these sitelinks are not representative, it signals that Google has misinterpreted the website's structure, content, or function. To ensure the accuracy of the sitelinks, he recommends employing strategies such as creating a clear site structure, categorizing pages by subject and theme, and undertaking other site development activities for better educating Google.",2,17,2023-03-24 18:18:47

However, SEOs tend to focus only on optimizing your website, which is a mistake because people can interact with you on various platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon. All these touchpoints on the way down to your website are crucial and can be optimized by looking at your Brand SERP. Your website should be used as a hub to indicate to Google what platforms are important to your audience by describing them on a dedicated webpage and linking out to them. This provides Google with clues on what you think your audience will be interested in.","Jason Barnard states that while your website acts as a representation of your brand and provides a platform for people to interact with you in your own domain, the mistake many SEOs make is focusing solely on optimizing just the website. He emphasizes that individuals can engage with the brand across various platforms like Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, and it's crucial to acknowledge all these interaction points. Optimizing these touchpoints can be achieved by examining your Brand SERP. The website should act as a central hub that signals to Google about other significant platforms your audience might be interested in.

This is because the content displayed on a Brand SERP is a reflection of Google's opinion of what is helpful, valuable, and interesting to a business's audience. Essentially, a Brand SERP reflects what Google thinks is important about a company's content and its overall reputation.

Jason explains that a Brand SERP is crucial for a business's bottom-of-funnel and post-funnel audience who already know the company and are interested in doing business with it. These are the users who are searching for the company's brand name or personal name on Google, and the content displayed on the Brand SERP serves as a virtual business card that can either encourage or discourage users from engaging with the business.

In short, a strong Brand SERP is not only important for a business's audience, but also for Google as it seeks to provide the most helpful and accurate information to its users. By understanding the importance of a Brand SERP, businesses can take steps to improve their online presence and ensure that their audience receives a positive and accurate representation of their brand.","Jason Barnard stresses that a formidable Brand SERP is not only essential for a business but also holds significance for Google. The content shown on a Brand SERP serves as an indicator of Google's belief about what is valuable, beneficial, and engaging for a business's audience. Essentially, a Brand SERP mirrors Google's viewpoint on the company's content and its overall standing. Jason points out that a Brand SERP is chiefly significant for a company's bottom-of-funnel and post-funnel audience who are already familiar with the brand and keen to associate with it. These individuals are the ones searching for the company's brand or individual name on Google, and the content presented on the Brand SERP operates as a digital business card that can either persuade or dissuade users from interacting with the business. In essence, a robust Brand SERP is crucial not just for a business's audience but also for Google as it strives to deliver the most precise and advantageous information to its users. By recognizing the value of a Brand SERP, businesses can endeavor to enhance their online visibility and ascertain that their audience gets a positive and genuine depiction of their brand.",2,17,2023-03-23 11:40:06

He advises against starting with the company's history or origin story, but instead recommends placing the most relevant and important information at the top of the page. This is because Google takes whatever is at the top as the most important and relevant content.

Jason emphasizes that the audience is the most important consideration when creating an About Us Page. For example, if someone is searching for The Brand SERP Guy, they want to know what he has to say about Brand SERPs, his approach to digital marketing, and what he can do with Knowledge Panels. He suggests that personal details, such as where he went to university, should be included at the end of the page for those who are interested. The key is to provide the audience with the information they need in a concise and organized way, so they can quickly and easily find what they are looking for.","Jason Barnard stresses that an 'About Us' page should contain at least 200 to ideal 500 words of factual description about a company. Rather than initiating with the company's origin or history, he advises prioritizing the most significant and relevant information at the start of the page. This is due to Google's algorithm that assigns higher importance to content at the top of the page. Jason places great emphasis on considering the audience when shaping an 'About Us' Page. For instance, if a user is searching for 'The Brand SERP Guy', they're likely interested in his stand on Brand SERPs, his digital marketing strategy, and his proficiency with Knowledge Panels. He suggests including personal details, such as his academic history, towards the end of the page for those interested.

If the goal is to target a specific audience, it may be necessary to use a niche vocabulary that appeals to that group. However, if the objective is to reach a broader audience, a wider vocabulary is needed. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the audience and their language preferences to communicate effectively.

In terms of writing for Google, it is crucial to use clear language that is easy for the search engine to understand. Google does not understand humor, irony, poetry, or culture, which means that using flowery language or being sarcastic may not help. The priority is to be clear and helpful to the audience. This clarity is beneficial for both the audience and Google, as the search engine aims to provide the best solution for its users as efficiently as possible.

It is important to keep in mind that Google is continually evolving and improving its ability to understand web content from a user's perspective. Therefore, it is crucial to aim for where Google is going, not just where it currently stands. By staying ahead of Google's progress, content creators can produce content that is not only clear and valuable to the audience but also optimized for search engines.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of employing appropriate vocabulary in communication. If the intent is to captivate a niche audience, deploying specialized vocabulary would be advantageous. Contrarily, if the goal is to attract a diverse audience, a more comprehensive range of terminology would be advisable. Thus, understanding your audience and accommodating their language preferences forms the bedrock of effective communication. When it comes to crafting content for Google, the emphasis should be on the use of lucid language that's easily interpretable by the search engine. Given that Google doesn't grasp humor, irony, poetry, or cultural nuances, overly ornate language or sarcasm might detract from the effectiveness of the content. The goal should be delivering clear and relevant content that serves both the audience and Google, as the search engine's primary mission is to present the most appropriate solutions to user queries in an expedited manner. It's vital to acknowledge that Google is engaged in a constant evolution to enhance its understanding of online content from a user perspective. Thus, content creators should aim to stay in step with Google's advances, ensuring their work is user-friendly, while also being optimized for search engine visibility.",2,17,2023-02-28 13:13:48

Google tries to find a single label to identify individuals, which can be difficult if there are multiple labels associated with that person. Google's summary of a person's brand is based on its understanding of who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. If the information displayed on a Brand SERP is not what is intended, it could be due to a lack of effective communication with Google.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of establishing a robust personal brand on Google, given that individuals frequently conduct a search of a person's name prior to interaction with them or their business. Google generally seeks to assign a sole label to identify an individual, presenting a challenge when there are several labels linked to the person. Google's synopsis of a person's brand hinges on its comprehension of their identity, their work, and their audience.

He advised businesses to ensure that their chosen brand name is not ambiguous or, if it is, that they can still dominate the Brand SERP. This is because Google will try to serve that ambiguity by showing other relevant results, which could impact the online presence of a company. Thus, before choosing a new brand name, businesses should think about how they will be represented online across all platforms, including their Brand SERP.

Jason also shared insights on brand name switching. While companies like Facebook can switch names smoothly, most brands struggle to do so. He revealed that he has built a SAS platform that can help with the switch. The platform finds all the references to the old brand and new brand and allows the user to change them all at once. This is a big job that can take up to six months of investment, but with the right tools, it can be done in a few days. Jason believes that if a brand can switch the information instantaneously, as Facebook did, Google will follow suit because it is that fast.

In summary, Jason emphasized the importance of considering Brand SERP from the start of choosing a brand name. He also provided insights on how brands can switch their names effectively using his SAS platform. According to him, while brand name switching can be a big job, it is possible to do it in a few days with the right tools.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of incorporating Brand SERP into the early stages of brand name selection. Businesses should avoid brand names that can cause ambiguity. If a name is ambiguous, they should strive to dominate their Brand SERP as Google might display other relevant results that could affect a company's online presence. Therefore, businesses should reflect on their online representation across various platforms, including their Brand SERP, before picking a new brand name. Jason also shared his experience with brand name changes. Although tech giants like Facebook make brand name changes look effortless, most brands face challenges. He has developed an SAS platform to assist with this transition. The platform identifies all mentions of the old and new brands, enabling the user to modify them simultaneously. This task could consume up to six months but can be completed within days using the correct tools. Jason believes that if a brand can update their information as quickly as Facebook did, Google will adapt accordingly due to its speed.

Therefore, when creating a Brand SERP, it is crucial to consider Google's perspective and provide an easy and efficient way for users to navigate to your site. Additionally, it is equally important to create a credible image of your brand for those who may not know you.

Jason emphasizes that a successful Brand SERP not only helps existing customers but also attracts potential ones. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the information Google displays about your brand and ensure that it presents a positive and trustworthy image. If Google is displaying negative information, it is essential to investigate why and make the necessary changes to your digital ecosystem. Ultimately, creating a successful Brand SERP requires a deep understanding of Google's perspective and a willingness to continuously improve and adapt to ensure a positive brand image.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of recognizing that Google's users may not automatically align with your own; they are individuals who could potentially be drawn to your brand. Therefore, when crafting a Brand SERP, you must adopt Google's viewpoint, making it straightforward and efficient for users to navigate to your site. Simultaneously, it's vital to establish a trustworthy impression of your brand for those unfamiliar with you. Jason accentuates that an efficient Brand SERP not only caters to existing customers, but also magnetizes potential ones. Consequently, it's important to analyze the information Google presents about your brand, ensuring it conveys a positive and reputable image. Should Google display negative information, it's crucial to investigate the reasons and accordingly make adjustments to your digital ecosystem. To sum up, building a successful Brand SERP calls for a solid understanding of Google's outlook and a readiness to consistently enhance and adapt to ensure a positive brand representation.",2,17,2023-02-23 14:26:07

So if your audience isn't engaging with videos, there's no point in creating videos. You need to interact with your audience where they want to interact with you, in the way that they want to interact with you. And Google will simply represent that. So, in theory, you should be in a situation where the content you need to create is the content you want to create and would create anyway to interact with your audience.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of tailoring your created content ? be it text, images, or videos ? to resonate with your audience. If your audience doesn't engage with videos, for example, producing them would be futile. The objective is to engage with your audience in their preferred manner and preferred platforms. Google simply mirrors this interaction. Consequently, ideally, the content you need to generate should align with the content you would naturally create to connect with your audience.",2,17,2023-02-23 05:05:48
875,Transcript,,Why Learning Basic NLP Rules and Principles is Essential for Content Creation and SEO,"Jason Barnard suggests that updating old articles is crucial to prevent content and relevancy decay, even if they are currently performing well. He recommends having a cycle to go back and update or republish old articles that may have lost relevance over time, especially since relevancy decay can occur after two years.

Jason also talks about the importance of filling in information gaps rather than simply focusing on search demand. He notes that even if other websites have answered a question, there may still be an information gap within their own site. He suggests that their topical authority, quality, velocity, and depth will eventually help them rank for many related terms. However, there are still many articles that need to be updated, and it will be a huge job to keep up with this cycle.

Additionally, Jason advises his team to learn basic NLP (Natural Language Processing) rules and principles to improve their content writing. He recommends reading the PDF for content writing, watching Ally's course on writing Entity Descriptions, and his own Knowledge Panel course. He also gives an example of using the Kalicube Pro Sandbox tool to understand how Google understands related entities, and notes that adding related entities can help Google understand and categorize a company.","Jason Barnard stresses the importance of updating existing articles to prevent the decay of content and relevance. This is a proactive process that he believes is necessary even for well-functioning content. He advocates a consistent cycle of revising, updating or republishing such articles, as relevance can decline after two years. Jason also explains the need to fill information gaps on one's own website rather than just focusing on the general search query, even if topics have already been covered on other websites. He suggests that attributes such as thematic authority, comprehensiveness, speed and depth of their content enable them to rank for multiple related terms. However, this means updating many articles to stay current. Jason also encourages his team to familiarize themselves with key NLP (Natural Language Processing) rules and principles to improve their content creation skills. To this end, he recommends resources such as a PDF on writing content, Ally's tutorial on writing entity descriptions and his own Knowledge Panel course.

It goes beyond just the first result, and instead, it shows the brand's ""Google business card."" This is incredibly important because these search engine results represent the brand to its bottom-of-the-funnel audience, who are deciding whether or not to do business with them. Therefore, the brand message needs to be reflected on the Google business card, and negative content needs to be dominated with positive content.

Brand SERPs go beyond just online reputation management, as they can also indicate whether Google has misunderstood the brand or its audience's perception of the brand. It is crucial to take the Brand SERP seriously as it is a free critique from Google about the brand's digital strategy. If a brand's investment in videos is not reflected on the Brand SERP when their name is searched, it implies that they are investing poorly in videos and that their digital strategy needs to be reassessed. The Brand SERP becomes a window into the brand's digital ecosystem and a way to see what is right or wrong with their digital strategy.","Jason Barnard stresses the significance of Brand SERPs due to their role in demonstrating Google's perspective of what's noteworthy, beneficial, and intriguing to a brand's audience. Brand SERPs extend beyond just the first result, acting as a 'Google business card' representative of your brand. This holds immense importance as these search results are presented to the audience at the bottom of the sales funnel who are considering conducting business with you. Therefore, it's essential for your brand's message to be mirrored on this 'Google business card', and any negative content should be outweighed by positive representations of your brand. Brand SERPs transcend mere online reputation management. They can also indicate any disconnect between Google's comprehension of the brand and the audience's perceived image of it. It's crucial for brands to treat their Brand SERPs with utmost seriousness, as it offers a free critique from Google on their digital strategy. For example, if a brand's investment in video content isn't represented on the Brand SERP when their name is searched, it signifies a poorly directed investment. This generally implies a need for reassessment of the brand's digital strategy. Thus, Brand SERPs serve as a portal into the brand's digital ecosystem, providing a clear perspective of the strengths and weaknesses in their digital strategy.",2,17,2023-03-27 15:24:06

He mentions that it is the new business card for a brand, which is easily understood by non-digital marketers, but not so much by digital marketers who often do not track or look at it regularly. He believes that it is the most important aspect of a brand's digital ecosystem and content strategy, and marketers should focus on taking control of it.

Jason also notes that the Brand SERP is the first thing people see when searching for a brand and should be treated as a Homepage. For local businesses, it is their actual Homepage. He emphasizes the need for marketers to take a step back and view the Brand SERP from the perspective of an independent analyst, client, prospect, journalist, or investor who is looking to find out more about the brand. By doing so, marketers can gain valuable insights into their brand's digital ecosystem and content strategy.","Jason Barnard stresses the significance of Google Brand SERP, stating that it serves as a business card for a brand. While the concept resonates with non-digital marketers, many digital professionals overlook it because they often do not constantly track or watch it. To him, it's the major cornerstone of a brand's digital ecosystem and content approach: businesses should aim to maintain it. Furthermore, Jason indicates that a Brand SERP is the initial thing searchers encounter when looking for a brand and thus should function as a Homepage, even going as far as to say that for local establishments, it truly is their Homepage. Jason underlines the importance of marketers taking a moment to examine the Brand SERP from an outsider's viewpoint, be it a detached observer, client, potential client, journalist, or investor that are keen on obtaining more detailed information on the brand.

He cites the example of their recent article on optimizing for SEO in SERPs and how it ranked on page two within a few days of publishing, despite the competition from big sites like SimilarWeb and Search Engine Watch, due to their topical authority, quality, velocity, depth, and breadth.

Jason also highlights the challenge of filling in all the gaps, given the multitude of possibilities and articles that still need to be checked, updated, or corrected. He suggests building a cycle to go back and update all articles every couple of years, involving Kristine to make the process smoother. Overall, he emphasizes the need to stay relevant and prevent content decay by regularly updating and improving articles.","Jason Barnard stresses the significance of prioritizing the 'information gap' rather than solely concentrating on search demand or specific inquiries. He explains that an 'information gap' refers not to unanswered questions across the web, but to those unanswered within one's own site. For illustration, he refers to their recently published article on SEO optimization in SERPs. Despite competing with impactful sites like SimilarWeb and Search Engine Watch, their article swiftly climbed to page two. The credit, according to Barnard, goes to their topical authority, quality, speed, depth, and extensive coverage. He also draws attention to the complexity of identifying and filling in all information gaps owing to the endless possibilities and the numerous articles that need to be checked, updated, or corrected. To manage this, he advocates for a routine cycle to revise all articles biennially and suggests involving Kristine in the process to ensure smooth execution.

He warns against the temptation to spread oneself too thin by talking about various topics, which could dilute one's authority on the primary subject matter.

Jason also introduces the concept of context clouds, a set of related words that clarify the meaning of the main keyword. Using the example of the word ""wave,"" he explains that relying solely on synonyms will not suffice. Instead, it's necessary to use words that commonly co-occur with the main keyword to convey the intended meaning accurately. Jason stresses the importance of using the right vocabulary and understanding the nuances of a particular topic to create effective context clouds. By doing so, websites can improve their chances of appearing as credible and authoritative sources in Google's search results.","Jason Barnard stresses the significance of the subject matter and its pertinence in the realm of current SEO.

He explained that Google functions similarly to humans in terms of building associations and that it is building a Knowledge Graph to understand the world, much like a human being does. Therefore, educating Google about who you are, what you do, and who your audience is through associations with entities and topics it already understands is key.

Jason also emphasized the importance of building confidence in Google's understanding of your brand. He suggested that Google may understand more than it shows, but lacks the confidence to display it. This is where corroboration by third-party trusted sources comes in, as it can help build confidence in Google's understanding of your brand. Overall, educating Google through associations and building confidence in its understanding of your brand are key strategies to improve your brand's presence on the search engine.","Jason Barnard strongly advocated for the strategic guidance of Google's understanding of your brand through specific association techniques. He described his personal efforts to redirect the association of his name with Google from a blue dog to his professional role as a digital marketer.

He explains that Google is looking for this reference point so that it can compare the information on the rest of the web to what the entity is saying about itself. This reference point can help an entity have some level of control or influence over what Google shows about them in search results.

Jason advises creating this Entity Home proactively and building Google's confidence in the entity's authority before any problems arise. Waiting until there is a problem is too late, as it will take time to build up that authority and influence.

This reference point equips the entity with a chance to shape or influence what Google displays about them in search results. Jason encourages the proactive establishment of this Entity Home and nurturing Google's trust in the entity's legitimacy before any issues emerge.

He focuses on her videos, which all come from her YouTube channel. He notes that while her videos appear in the Video Boxes on the main SERP, the videos from her website do not.

Jason explains that the reason for this is the absence of schema markup on her site. Google displays videos with schema markup in the Video Boxes on the main SERP instead of those from YouTube. The rationale behind this is that pages on a website offer more context that is relevant to the audience searching for a brand name than those on YouTube. He suggests that by adding video schema markup to her website, Marie Forleo can potentially secure more real estate in the main SERP for her videos.","Jason Barnard studies the Brand SERP for American businesswoman Marie Forleo.

The popular products section is not Google Ads but rather information gathered by Google about available products to buy. This means that as a company's product offerings grow, the number of brand SERPs that need to be managed also grows, including entity SERPs for the people around the brand.

Jason suggests that dealing with these various brand and entity SERPs will become a significant task over time, so companies should start with managing their foundational brand SERP as soon as possible. In this way, they can be better prepared to handle the growing number of brand SERPs related to their expanding product offerings. Each product has its own brand SERP, and companies need to manage them as they would their own foundational brand SERP.

However, Jason's main focus is on the videos section of the search results, where he notes that YouTube, which typically dominates in Brand SERPs, does not appear to be doing a great job in this particular case.

Jason points out that while there are only two videos from YouTube in the search results, Ware herself and her publisher, Simon and Schuster, are doing a lot of work to dominate the search results with videos from their own sites.

Therefore, businesses should create content to push onto platforms other than Google, make them pay for themselves on their native platforms, and then repackage them for Google as a bonus. This approach may be more effective in the long run because Google could end up repurposing secondary content instead of primary content.

Jason suggests that Google is looking ahead ten years and is focused on the next few years. However, if businesses prioritize creating content that satisfies and brings value to their users on platforms other than Google, they may be able to turn things around. While this approach may seem naive, it has the potential to lead to a future where Google repurposes secondary content instead of primary content.","Jason Barnard suggests Google has evolved beyond being just a search engine, now serving as an answer engine and an assistant. Thus, his advice to businesses is to develop content for alternative platforms first, ensuring it becomes profitable there, and then reformat it for Google as an added bonus. This method, he believes, might enhance long-term effectiveness as Google might recirculate secondary content instead of primary content. Even though Google is planning for the decade ahead, focusing on the coming few years, businesses can counter this by concentrating on producing valuable content for their users on platforms other than Google. While this strategy may appear overly simplistic, it harbors the potential for a future where Google redistributes secondary content instead of primary content.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:28:43

If your users are not leaving reviews on any platform, then a review site is not a good target for leapfrogging above other content. Instead, your own social media channels like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube are typically the easiest results to push up as they can drive engagement that Google sees. Twitter is especially effective as it has a direct feed into Google.

Driving user engagement on your social media channels will help push them up in the search results and potentially outrank a review site on the ranking page. If you can show Google that your audience is truly engaging with your social media channels, it will recognize them as valid, relevant, and helpful, and the review site will be seen as less relevant, less helpful, and less valuable to your current audience. This will help reduce the visibility of the review site and potentially remove it from the first page of search results.","Jason Barnard suggests that any content, if found valuable and relevant by Google, can replace any other content. If garnering reviews on platforms isn't a common occurrence for your users, aiming to outperform these platforms via leapfrogging may not be the ideal strategy. It might be more fruitful to focus on your social media platforms?such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube?where driving user engagement could be more successful. Twitter can be especially impactful, given its direct feed into Google. By fostering user interaction on your social media channels, you can potentially boost their search result rankings, possibly outdoing a review site. If significant engagement on your social media channels can be demonstrated to Google, it will regard them as valid, relevant, and valuable, thereby diminishing the perceived relevance and value of the review site. This could decrease the visibility of the review site, even potentially eliminating it from the first page of search results.

But three months is just the surface of your Google business card. If you want it to be one hundred percent, it might take four years to create the content that allows Google to show you the way you want it to. So it's a tremendous amount of work over a long period of time.

Jason said if you think about it, that's what business is all about. It's not about becoming a one-hit wonder overnight. It's about building a brand's image in the eyes of the audience over a long period of time. And all Google does is reflect that brand image the way you presented it to your audience online anyway. So it's a lot of work and a lot of time.","Jason Barnard suggests that approximately three months are required for Google to reflect your desired narrative. This initial three months, however, only scratches the surface of your digital persona or ""Google business card."" For a complete and refined image, it may take up to four years of content creation to guide Google towards the portrayal you seek. This lengthy process, while intensive, mirrors the patience and determination necessary in establishing a business. Overnight success is rare; instead, businesses grow their reputation over an extended period, shaping their brand's image in the minds of their audience. Google simply mirrors this brand image based on how it has been presented online. Therefore, creating a comprehensive and accurate Google business card requires a significant investment of time and effort.",2,17,2023-02-23 04:50:41

When someone searches for your brand name and sees positive results, it improves Google's understanding of your credibility, your own content strategy, and your digital ecosystem. Your digital ecosystem includes everything related to you, such as your clients, audience, and ex-clients. Therefore, improving your Brand SERP can have a positive impact on your overall online presence.","Jason Barnard suggests that enhancing your Brand SERP carries multiple advantages. When positive results appear in response to your brand name search, it bolsters Google's perception of your authenticity, your content tactics, and your encompassing digital environment. This digital environment comprises all aspects connected to you, including your clients, target audience, and former customers.

He explains that his diverse career as a musician, songwriter, TV series creator, voice actor, and digital marketer specializing in Brand SERPs is difficult for Google to represent correctly. Jason believes that his multifacetedness presents an opportunity for him to experiment with ways to educate Google's Knowledge Graph to accurately represent his career.

Jason gives an example of his songs appearing prominently in the Knowledge Graph despite not being the most important aspect of his current career. He believes that it is important to convince the Knowledge Graph to prioritize his current focus on digital marketing, Brand SERPs, and authorship, while still representing his past accomplishments accurately. He sees this as a chance to shape the representation of his online presence and enhance his commercial success.","Jason Barnard suggests that Google's Knowledge Graph faces challenges when depicting a person's diverse accomplishments, or multifacetedness. He cites his wide-ranging roles, from being a musician and songwriter to a voice actor for a TV series and currently, a digital marketer who is a specialist in Brand SERPs. Jason views these complications as an opportunity to guide the Knowledge Graph towards a more accurate portrayal of his professional life. He notes that while his songs frequently appear in the Knowledge Graph, they may not be the most relevant part of his contemporary career. Therefore, he is keen on persuading the Knowledge Graph to highlight his current digital marketing career, Brand SERPs, and authorship appropriately, while maintaining due recognition for his previous achievements.

829,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/the-unscripted-seo-interview-with-jason-barnard/,The Effect of Geo Sensitivity in Terms of Having the Same Personal Name,"According to Jason Barnard, there are unique challenges when it comes to Brand SERPs for people. People are naturally multifaceted, making it challenging for Google to understand all the different aspects of their identities. Additionally, there are often many homonyms, people with the same name, making it important for individuals to educate Google about who they are in order to stand out from their homonyms. Confidence is key in dominating your Brand SERP and ensuring that Google shows your content rather than that of your homonyms.

Geo also plays a crucial role in shaping Brand SERPs for people. Google interprets the same name differently across different countries based on the probability of the person being interesting to that audience. For example, a search for Mary Moore in America brings up Mary Tyler Moore, while a search for the same name in Ireland brings up the daughter of Henry Moore. This probabilistic nature is aimed at presenting information that is most likely to be helpful and useful to the searcher, based on their intent.","Jason Barnard suggests that handling Brand SERPs presents distinct challenges when it comes to individuals. Human beings are inherently multifaceted, which creates difficulty for Google in capturing all the various elements of their identities accurately. Furthermore, the presence of homonyms, or individuals sharing the same name, necessitates educating Google about oneself to differentiate from others with similar names. Confidence plays a pivotal role in getting ahead in your Brand SERP and ensuring Google displays your own content as opposed to that of your homonyms. Geographical location is also a critical factor in shaping Brand SERPs for individuals. Google interprets identical names differently across diverse countries based on the perceived relevance and interest to that audience. For instance, a search for Mary Moore in the US presents Mary Tyler Moore, whereas a search in Ireland leads to the daughter of Henry Moore. This probabilistic approach ensures information that is likely the most assistance and utility to the searcher, based on their intent, is presented.",2,17,2023-03-30 17:25:20
843,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/the-unscripted-seo-interview-with-jason-barnard/,The Idea of a Homepage as Stepping Stone to Other Destinations Is an Important Concept to Remember,"According to Jason Barnard, if your website is entirely about you, then the Homepage is the best place to be the Entity Home. This is because Google will take the Homepage as the Entity Home because it is the most powerful page. However, if you are a company, the About Us Page is the best place to explain factually who you are, what you do, and who your audience is. If Google chooses the Homepage as the Entity Home anyway, then you need to go with the flow because Google is pretty stubborn.

Jason also emphasizes that the Homepage is never a destination in and of itself, but rather a stepping stone to other destinations. Therefore, the key to the Homepage is not to sell products directly or explain everything about your company, but to help users on their journey to the sales page, blog, help page, contact us page, or other destinations. The Homepage should provide users with clear options and help them navigate to where they want to go.","Jason Barnard suggests that if a website is solely focused on an individual, the homepage is the optimal choice for the 'Entity Home' since it is considered the most influential page by Google. Conversely, for a company, the 'About Us' page serves as the perfect space to present factual information about what the company is, who they serve, and their functions. In cases where Google identifies the homepage as the 'Entity Home' despite attempts to designate the 'About Us' page, it is best to adapt and proceed accordingly due to Google's obstinacy. Jason also highlights that the homepage is not a final stop but acts as a gateway to other areas of the site, such as the sales page, blog, assistance section, and contact page. Rather than directly marketing products or detailing all aspects of the company, the homepage should guide users through their journey, directing them to their desired destination and providing clear navigational options.",2,17,2023-03-30 18:07:12

Your Brand SERP needs to be continually updated to reflect your current digital strategy and ecosystem, even after the initial three to four month work to get it looking great to your audience. Jason gives an example of how his Brand SERP initially misrepresents him as a cartoon blue dog when he started working in digital marketing. This misrepresentation affected his ability to sign clients, and he realized the importance of Brand SERPs. He spent three to four months changing the message that Google was giving his audience when they searched his name to reflect him as a digital marketer. After updating his Brand SERP, it accurately reflected his current profession, digital marketing, and his relevant contributions, with his previous role as a cartoon blue dog being mentioned as an afterthought.

By updating and maintaining your Brand SERP, you can accurately represent who you are, what you do, and who your audience is today. An accurate Brand SERP can also positively impact your business as it can attract potential clients who may be searching for your name or your company's name on Google. Therefore, businesses and individuals should prioritize maintaining their Brand SERPs to reflect their current digital strategy and ecosystem accurately.","Jason Barnard suggests that it's vital to consistently update your Brand SERP as your digital ecosystem evolves. It must regularly reflect your present digital strategy and ecosystem to remain appealing and relevant to your audience. Jason shares his own experience where his initial Brand SERP falsely represented him as a cartoon blue dog, which hindered his ability to secure clients in the digital marketing field. After acknowledging the significance of Brand SERPs, he committed three to four months to alter Google's narrative surrounding him. This made his Brand SERP accurately portray him as a professional in digital marketing instead of a cartoon character, with only an incidental reference to his past role. Maintaining and updating your Brand SERP is critical to accurately showcase your identity, role, and target audience. This accuracy can also enhance your business opportunities by drawing potential clients who might be searching your or your company's name on Google. As a result, both businesses and individuals should give utmost importance to consistently updating their Brand SERPs to ensure they accurately mirror their current digital strategy and environment.",2,17,2023-03-28 16:59:28
881,Transcript,,The Rise of Knowledge Panel Management in SEO: Establishing Authority and Trust,"According to Jason Barnard, Knowledge Panel Management will become the default SEO in the future. Knowledge Panels represent authority in the eyes of both search engines and users. This indicates that Google has understood and is confident in its understanding of a website's authority in its industry. A good Knowledge Panel or Brand SERP is crucial as it projects authority to the audience and acts as Google's stamp of approval. Hence, businesses should focus on managing their Knowledge Panel to increase their online authority and reputation.","Jason Barnard suggests that Knowledge Panel Management will be the norm for future SEO. Knowledge Panels constitute credibility, perceived by both search engines and users, demonstrating that Google has affirmed a website's expertise in its sector. A robust Knowledge Panel, or Brand SERP, is vital as it conveys authority to the public and serves as Google's endorsement.

429,Transcript,https://kalicube.com/learning-spaces/talks-and-presentations/brand-serps-talks/do-you-know-what-your-online-reputation-is/,The Entity Home: Where You Live Online,"According to Jason Barnard, video can be intimidating, and starting with audio is a great way to ease into it. Focusing on your voice first allows you to become comfortable with the medium before adding the visual component. Writing is also a relatively easier way to create content as it doesn't require putting your voice or face on the line. It's important to remember that the best place to start creating content is on your own website. Google and other machines want to understand who you are, what you do, and who your audience is, and they start by looking at your website. Even a simple one-page website that introduces yourself and your interests is a good starting point.

Jason advises building out your online presence from there, whether it's on social media, writing for other people, or expanding your website. If you don't have a website, there are simple platforms like Wix that allow you to create a website by dragging and dropping elements, similar to using Microsoft Word. Building your online presence should start with what Jason calls the Entity Home, the place where you live online for Google and other machines. By starting with your website and building out from there, you can ensure that your online presence is focused and consistent, and reflects who you are and what you have to offer.","Jason Barnard suggests that starting with audio content can provide a less daunting gateway into video production. Beginning with your voice allows you to gain confidence in the medium before dealing with the visual aspect. Alternately, content writing is another less intimidating entry point as it doesn't require presenting voice or appearance initially. A crucial reminder from Jason is that the ideal starting point for content creation is your own website. Your website is the primary resource for Google and other search engines to understand who you are, your area of expertise, and your target audience. Even a simple single-page website, adequately describing yourself and your interests, is a positive commencement. From this point, Jason recommends expanding your online presence, whether through social media or guest authorships, or further developing your own website. If you're yet to create a website, user-friendly platforms like Wix make the process approachable by employing a drag-and-drop feature, bearing similarity to the Microsoft Word interface. Jason highlights the concept of the 'Entity Home', the virtual residence you hold for Google and similar platforms, when initiating your online presence. This approach ensures your online persona bears a focus and consistency that genuinely represents you and what you present to the world.",2,17,2023-02-23 06:18:40

However, he argues that it's not always the best option. He shares an example of how he tried moving his entity home from his homepage to an About Me page, and Google reacted by wiping out the entire thing. In contrast, other entities that had their homes in the same place with Schema Markup and clear explanations remained unaffected by such changes. Jason emphasizes the importance of providing a clear and consistent crutch for search engines to rely on when determining an entity's home.","Jason Barnard suggests that the common perception is that a company's homepage serves as it's 'entity home' - the primary point of reference for search engines. However, he challenges this notion, suggesting that it may not be the optimal choice. He recalls an instance when he attempted to shift his entity home from the homepage to an 'About Me' page, resulting in Google completely removing the entity. Interestingly, other entities that maintained their entity homes at the same location, armed with Schema Markup and unambiguous explanations, remained resilient to such modifications.

However, Google wants to show your brand message if it is relevant and helpful to your audience, and you can control it. It is up to you to ensure that Google knows what it should be presenting.

When it comes to hiring, Jason realized that it was more effective to find people and then fit the jobs to them, rather than trying to find people who could do specific jobs. He would interview candidates and then ask them what they liked and did not like doing before fitting them into the available roles.

Jason was able to build a successful digital marketing company by pitching his services to clients. However, he found that his clients were searching for his name on Google after their meetings, and were finding a cartoon blue dog instead of his professional brand. He decided to take control of his Brand SERP and made sure that it showed him as a digital marketer first and a blue dog second. This increased his conversion rate from 50% to 80% in situations where he had sold face-to-face.","Jason Barnard suggests that the Google Brand SERP may not necessarily mirror the brand image you've consciously developed on your website and social platforms. Despite this, he asserts that Google is inclined to present your brand story if it is pertinent and beneficial to your audience and that you have the power to influence this. It falls upon you to ascertain that Google is well informed about the image it needs to project. When considering recruitment, Jason discovered that tailoring job roles to individuals was more productive than identifying people to fulfill certain roles. He would first converse with potential applicants, understanding their preferences and dislikes before slotting them into suitable positions. Through selling his digital marketing services, Jason built a thriving company. However, he noticed that after meetings with clients, they would look up his name on Google only to stumble upon a cartoon blue dog, causing a disconnect in his professional image. Jason decided to seize control of his Brand SERP to primarily highlight his persona as a digital marketer, while demoting the blue dog representation.

816,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/knowledge-panels-talks/knowledge-panels-for-people-vs-companies-with-jason-barnard/,Optimising a Knowledge Panel for a Company,"According to Jason Barnard, there is a fundamental difference in the approach towards personal branding and company branding. A company has trademark protection within a given georegion and industry, making it less ambiguous. On the other hand, personal branding faces the problem of ambiguity since there could be many people with the same name. To deal with this issue, one must start building a personal brand from the place where they have the most relevance and then build out from there.

Jason emphasizes the importance of educating Google about one's business, regardless of whether it is a personal or company brand. Google's focus is on understanding the information provided, not on notability. Therefore, the foundational strategy for any business online is to communicate to Google who they are, what they do, and who their audience is. This way, Google can represent them well on their Brand SERP and understand when they might be a great solution for its users when they search for a solution to their problem.","Jason Barnard suggests that the strategies for personal branding and company branding are fundamentally varied. While companies have the comfort of trademarks which provides them protection within their sector and geographical areas, thereby reducing ambiguity, personal branding doesn't share the same privilege. Since there could be many individuals with the same name, ambiguity becomes an issue in personal branding. The solution to this involves starting the process of developing a personal brand from where one has maximum relevance and gradually broadening from there. Regardless of whether it's corporate or personal branding, Jason underscores the need to educate Google about one's business operations. Google's emphasis is on comprehending the data provided, rather than the individual's significance. Hence, irrespective of the type of business, the fundamental approach should be to clearly convey the nature of the business, the services or products it offers, and its target audience. This strategy enables Google to accurately represent the business on their Brand SERP and identify when it could be the optimal solution to user queries.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:38:34

Pool searches refer to brand searches, and they have become increasingly important because people are now being informed on Google up to the point of purchase. Therefore, having a strong presence on Google, including a well-managed brand SERP with Filter Pills, is crucial for businesses to make a sale. Jason notes that companies must focus on managing the different facets of their entity, such as products, videos, CEO, and key people, to ensure that they are presenting themselves in the best light to their audience. By doing so, they can explain to Google what their best light looks like, and Google will present them in the best possible way to potential customers.","Jason Barnard suggests, as indicated by John Mueller, that Brand Searches or Pool Searches hold substantial significance for businesses, brands, and SEO professionals. Pool searches essentially equate to brand searches, and their relevance has surged in line with the trend of consumers using Google as a key source of information up until the point of purchase. Thus, establishing and maintaining a robust Google presence, inclusive of a well-curated brand SERP with Filter Pills, becomes pivotal for businesses to secure sales. Jason advises companies to diligently manage various elements of their entities, such as products, videos, CEOs, and primary individuals.

He also emphasizes the importance of managing one's Brand SERP because Google pushes video content to the fore, and different videos appear on different verticals of the search results.

Jason believes that as entities on Google with the Brand SERP, the entertainment industry has an increasing number of different parameters and variations of the content presented to people who are researching them.

However, important questions like 'What kind of drugs does the company make?' and 'What is Merck known for?' are not answered. Barnard suggests a simple solution to this omission: If you create a website that clearly answers these unanswered questions, you may be able to secure the 'People Also Ask' section on your Brand SERP. He describes this as half a success for Merck in managing 'People Also Ask' on their Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-02-22 12:43:25
412,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/mcdonalds/,Strange Ranking of the Twitter Boxes on McDonald?s? Brand SERP,"Jason Barnard examines the brand SERP for McDonald's, a fast food restaurant company. On the right side of the SERP, you see the Knowledge Panel. And like many large companies, they haven't really claimed it. For Jason, it's quite a mess and something they should claim and try to control as best they can.

Jason has also observed that Google has placed a map pack at the top, even on the desktop, he searches for Canada and in Google's opinion Jason wants to eat McDonald's, which is a reasonable assumption. When he scrolls down, their website ranks second, then People Also Ask, some bluelinks, Top Stories and then the Twitter boxes.

And that's what Jason wanted to focus on, because the Twitter boxes are about three-quarters of the way down. Usually you see the Twitter boxes at the top, usually second. And this is where Google has decided that the Twitter boxes are important, but not so important that they have to outrank the Top Stories or the Google Map Pack. This goes against the notion that Jason always had that Twitter boxes always appear in second or third place, they don't, they can even appear in seventh or eighth place. So that's a new piece of information that Jason didn't know.

Jason now knows this and can work accordingly when helping people and businesses optimize their brand SERPs. Jason's understanding of how Google uses Twitter boxes has changed: Twitter boxes can also appear in the seventh or eighth results, or even at the very bottom of a brand SERP, and the other rich elements that tend to appear at the bottom can be placed at the top if it suits the user's needs.","Jason Barnard takes a closer look at McDonald's Brand SERP, revealing some surprising observations. On the right-hand side, the Knowledge Panel is noticeable. However, like numerous large corporations, McDonald's hasn't claimed it, resulting in a rather disorderly display that Jason suggests should be appropriated and managed better. Of interest is Google's decision to place the Map Pack at the top of the SERP, even on desktop search - this happens when Jason searches within Canada, leading Google to assume an interest in visiting McDonald's. Scrolling further down reveals the company's website in second position, followed by 'People Also Ask', some bluelinks, 'Top Stories', and finally, the Twitter boxes. What intrigues Jason is the placement of these Twitter boxes roughly three-quarters of the way down the SERP, contradicting the usual norm of them appearing at the top, usually in second place. However, this highlights Google's strategic prioritizing of elements on the SERP, deeming Twitter boxes as important, but not essential enough to outrank the 'Top Stories' or the 'Google Map Pack'. This alters Jason's previous understanding that Twitter boxes invariably feature in the second or third slot, proving they can also appear as low as the seventh or eighth position. Jason's newfound understanding allows for better optimization strategies for Brand SERPs - taking into account the flexibility of Twitter box placement, alongside other rich elements, according to user needs.",2,17,2023-02-22 12:27:30
549,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/localbusiness/costco-wholesale//,People Also Ask in Costco?s Google My Business Panel,"Jason Barnard analyzes the Brand SERP for Costco Wholesale in San Francisco. He notes that the Brand SERP displays only blue links on the left-hand side, which he finds a bit disappointing. However, what's interesting about this particular Brand SERP is that the Google My Business panel displays two entity statements, similar to the People Also Ask feature. The statements ask about the pay and salary at Costco, but the company hasn't answered them. Jason suggests that Costco should provide answers to these questions to improve their Google My Business profile and provide valuable information to potential customers.

By answering these questions within their own Google My Business panel, Costco can improve their brand image and potentially attract more customers. Jason advises that businesses should actively monitor their Brand SERP and Google My Business profile to ensure they are providing accurate and useful information to potential customers. Overall, businesses should aim to create a comprehensive content strategy that includes visual elements such as images and videos, as well as answering important questions about their brand and industry.","Jason Barnard takes a keen look at the Brand SERP for Costco Wholesale in San Francisco and finds that the Brand SERP only displays blue links on the left-hand side, which he finds slightly disappointing. Interestingly, the Google My Business panel presents two unanswered entity questions, much like the People Also Ask feature, asking about Costco's remuneration and salaries. Barnard advises Costco to address these questions directly on their Google My Business profile to enrich their profile and offer valuable insights to prospective customers. With direct responses in their own Google My Business panel, Costco may enhance their brand reputation and potentially draw in more customers. Jason recommends businesses maintain active surveillance of their Brand SERP and Google My Business profile to verify the accuracy and helpfulness of the information they are providing to potential customers. In short, businesses should strive to establish a thorough content strategy that incorporates visual aids like images and videos, and responds to crucial inquiries about their brand and industry.",2,17,2023-03-17 08:54:27

However, as Jason scrolls down, he notes that there are more than 40 results that continue to load, making it more complicated for Brand SERP work, particularly on mobile. This means that SEO professionals will have to deal with more than just the first page on mobile, making the work more intricate, longer, and difficult.

Jason also mentions the importance of getting into the Knowledge Graph, which could potentially get Knife Warehouse's own logo onto the People Also Search For list and reduce the impact of competitors sitting there. Nonetheless, the main focus of the video is the increasing complexity and difficulty of Brand SERP work, particularly with the continuous loading of results beyond the first page.","Jason Barnard talks about the Brand SERP of Knife Warehouse, an online knife retail platform. He observes how the brand dominates its SERP with its multiple websites spread across distinct countries. However, he points out an issue where more than 40 results keep loading as he scrolls down, complicating the Brand SERP work, especially on mobile devices. This implies that SEO experts are for not only the first page but beyond on mobile, increasing the complexity and length of the task. Jason highlights the significance of being part of the Knowledge Graph as it can possibly incorporate Knife Warehouse's logo into the People Also Search For section, minimizing the effect of competitive brands. Nevertheless, the video's primary emphasis is on the escalating intricacy of Brand SERP work due to the ongoing loading of results beyond the first page.",2,17,2023-03-17 10:23:35
865,Transcript,,"Leveraging E-E-A-T for Brand Success: Importance of Social Media, Unique Visuals, and Professionalism","Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) in helping brands leverage their social media accounts, unique visuals, product lines and positive reviews. He stresses the need for social media accounts like Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, to show the existence of the brand and maintain their presence. Google relies not only on content but on the fact that the brand is active and people are talking about it.

Unique visuals are another crucial factor in building a Brand's E-E-A-T. He also highlights the importance of incorporating a touch of personality to the visuals with the help of little illustrations. However, he cautions that when selling, the emphasis should be on reducing the scribbly aspect of the visuals, while it should be increased when aiming for a fun and friendly look.

In conclusion, Jason stresses the significance of maintaining a balance between the scribbly and professional aspects of visuals while keeping the E-E-A-T of the brand in mind. Brands should focus on building their expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness by leveraging social media accounts, unique visuals, product lines, and positive reviews.","Jason Barnard underlines the crucial role that experience, competence, authority and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T) play in the success of a brand. He highlights the usefulness of platforms such as Twitter, LinkedIn and YouTube to authenticate a brand's existence and ensure lasting visibility. For Google, E-E-A-T depends not only on the quality of the content, but also on how alive the brand is and how strong the audience engagement is.
Distinctive images are a key element in increasing a brand's E-E-A-T. To achieve this, brands need to give their imagery its own personality, which is usually achieved through artistic illustrations. However, Jason advises brands to adapt the playful element of their imagery to their objectives. In a sales situation, a more subdued approach is preferred, while a lively, friendly look is welcome in a more informal context.

Essentially, Jason Barnard stresses the importance of finding a balance between playful and serious tones in visual design, while keeping the E-E-A-T of the brand at the forefront. He advises brands to strengthen their competence, authority and trustworthiness through the strategic use of social media platforms, unique visual content and product lines, and to harness positive feedback.",2,17,2023-03-31 19:41:48
894,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/be-bold-branding-how-to-perfect-your-brand-messaging-on-google-search/,Separating Your Personal Life From Your Business and the Importance of Relationships in Google?s Understanding,"Jason Barnard discusses the importance of understanding Google's entity recognition and how to ensure your dominant facet is accurately reflected on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). According to Jason, Google is still a relatively young technology and often struggles to understand the multifaceted nature of individuals. Therefore, it needs one dominant title to attribute to an individual, such as author or musician. This means it's up to individuals to educate Google by ensuring their Entity Home - the webpage on their own website that represents them and their full range of skills and interests - is well-developed.

Jason stresses that having an Entity Home is critical to ensuring that Google accurately understands who you are and what you have to offer. He cites the example of his sister, a film director, who has not taken responsibility for creating an Entity Home, leading Google to rely heavily on Wikipedia and leaving a low level of confidence in its understanding of her. Additionally, he emphasizes that individuals must remember they are not just their company, and it's vital to ensure that Google accurately represents their relationships with close family members, which Google understands to be close, strong, and long-lasting relationships, and ultimately, more valuable for search rankings.

Finally, Jason notes that relationships such as mother, father, and founder are seen as permanent and unbreakable in Google's eyes, and therefore, more valuable to search rankings. By understanding Google's entity recognition and taking ownership of their Entity Home, individuals can ensure they are accurately represented on SERPs and improve their overall search rankings.","Jason Barnard underlines the importance of comprehending Google's entity recognition, allowing an individual's dominant attribute to be accurately displayed on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs). Jason explains that Google is still a budding technology that often struggles with recognizing multiple characteristics of an individual, thus preferring a single dominant descriptor such as a writer or artist. This makes it incumbent upon individuals to ""school"" Google by perfecting their Entity Home, a personal webpage that serves as a representation of their personality, skills, and interests. Jason insists that the creation of an Entity Home is fundamental to ensuring Google's accurate comprehension of one's identity and offerings. Illustrating this point, he uses the case of his sister, a movie director who neglected to develop her Entity Home. As a result, Google primarily relied on Wikipedia, culminating in a limited level of confidence in its interpretation of her. Furthermore, he accentuates the need for individuals to separate their professional and personal personas, emphasizing the importance of accurately reflecting familial relationships in Google's evaluation. Google perceives familial ties as close, enduring, and of significant value for search rankings. He also points out that roles such as a parent or founder are considered by Google to be unvarying, making them beneficial for search positioning. By grasping Google's entity recognition and taking charge of their Entity Home, individuals can guarantee an accurate representation of themselves on SERPs, thereby heightening their search rankings.",2,17,2023-04-01 13:06:12

He emphasized that people tend to Google others' names before interacting or doing business with them, making it essential to have a strong online presence. Writing a book is an effective way to get Google to understand who you are and what you do. Jason stated that he realized the book made a significant difference in Google's understanding of him, which helped with personal branding. The book acts as a tool that not only appeals to audiences but also to Google in understanding and identifying an individual's personal brand.","Jason Barnard underscored the significance of creating a robust personal brand on Google, achievable through authoring a book. He noted that most individuals Google someone's name before engaging or doing business, reinforcing the necessity for impressive online visibility. Penning a book becomes an efficient tactic to help Google comprehend your identity and profession. Jason observed that the book notably augmented Google's perception of him, aiding in personal branding. The book serves as an instrument that captivates audiences, while also assisting Google in recognizing and pinpointing a person's unique brand.",2,17,2023-04-01 12:50:47

He shared his experience of committing to providing a new game, animation, song, and craft activity every month on the first day of the month for a website he developed. However, he sometimes found himself behind schedule, needing to write and record a song in a day and animate it to meet the deadline. Despite the stress, he found the exercise to be valuable in forcing him to push through challenges and keep his promises.

Jason notes that consistency is crucial in building trust with customers and delivering on expectations. Even when faced with unexpected obstacles or setbacks, sticking to commitments can help establish a strong reputation and build loyalty among customers. He believes that pushing oneself to deliver on promises, even when it's challenging, is a valuable exercise in discipline and determination.","Jason Barnard underscored the significance of maintaining consistency in fulfilling commitments in a recent discussion. He recounted his commitment to provide a fresh game, animation, tune, and handcraft activity on his website on the first of every month. Nevertheless, he occasionally found himself striving to meet the deadline, needing to pen and record a melody in a single day and animate it. Regardless of the pressure, he found the endeavor valuable in navigating through difficulties and standing by his commitments. Jason points out that constancy is vital in fostering trust with clients and meeting their expectations. Confronted with unforeseen hurdles or delays, adhering to commitments can assist in forging a solid reputation and fostering customer loyalty. He is of the view that propelling oneself to fulfill promises, even under tough circumstances, is a noteworthy exercise in self-discipline and persistence.",2,17,2023-03-16 06:54:24
834,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/other/the-unscripted-seo-interview-with-jason-barnard/,The Brand SERP Is A Great Reflection Of Google's Understanding Of Your Brand And Your Communication With The Audience.,"Jason Barnard explains that a Brand SERP is a reflection of how well Google has understood a business. It is a measurement of how well a business is communicating with its audience. If Google is getting it wrong, it indicates that the business is not communicating effectively. In this case, a business needs to re-strategize its digital marketing efforts.

Jason also mentions that building a brand on different platforms with lots of content takes sustained effort and patience. He gives an example of his company, Kalicube, which has taken a year and a half to build its brand. The traffic to Kalicube's website is coming from different sources such as LinkedIn, Twitter, email, and direct visits. Google has started to recognize the value of the service that Kalicube is offering to its audience. Consequently, the traffic from Google has started to increase over the past few months. He emphasizes that building a brand takes time, effort, and patience. The results may not be immediate, but they will pay dividends in the long term.","Jason Barnard underscores that a Brand SERP is essentially Google's understanding of a business, reflecting how effectively a business is communicating with its audience. If Google's interpretation is off, it implies that the business needs to boost its communication strategies or overhaul its digital marketing measures. He cautions that creating a brand presence across various platforms through abundant content dissemination requires enduring commitment and patience. Using Kalicube as a case study, Jason reveals the brand has been a product of a year and a half of dedicated effort. Traffic to Kalicube's site originates from diverse sources, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, email, and direct visits, a dynamic Google noticed and subsequently began acknowledging the utility of Kalicube's service to its audience. As a result, Google-driven traffic has been on the upswing in recent months.

719,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/talks/brand-serps-talks/brand-serps-and-how-to-boost-them/,Google Adapts Its Results According to the Geo Locality of the Searcher,"According to Jason Barnard, a major issue with personal branding is that names tend to be duplicated, making it difficult for Google to accurately identify which individual a user is searching for. To mitigate this issue, Google adapts its search results based on the geographic location of the user. For example, if someone in the UK searches for Ian Gray, Google will likely show results for a different Ian Gray than if someone in the US were to search for the same name.

Jason gives the example of Mary Moore to illustrate how Google adapts its search results. In the US, search results for Mary Moore will likely show actresses, especially Mary Tyler Moore. In the UK, search results may show the daughter of a sculptor, while in Australia, search results may show a judge. Google may even add a middle name or other details to search results if it thinks it will help users find the right individual.

For individuals with common names, Jason suggests focusing on building a local presence first, starting with their hometown, then their home county or state, then their country, and finally the regions where they want to have a presence for their audience. If someone is not present in a particular region, they should not worry about it, as Google will adapt search results to reflect the user's location.","Jason Barnard underscores that one of the main challenges in personal branding comes from name duplicity, which can confound Google when trying to accurately identify the person a user is searching for. As a workaround, Google adjusts its search results according to the user's geographic location. For instance, a search for ""Ian Gray"" may yield different results for a user in the UK compared to a user in the US. Jason uses ""Mary Moore"" as an exemplar to demonstrate how Google tailors its search results. In the US, ""Mary Moore"" searches may primarily display actresses like Mary Tyler Moore. In contrast, the same search in the UK might lead to results about a sculptor's daughter, and in Australia, it might highlight a judge. Sometimes, Google might even append a middle name or additional details to search results in its bid to direct users to the correct individual. For those saddled with common names, Jason advises building a localized presence, commencing with their hometown, followed by the home county or state, then their country, and expanding their presence to preferred regions. He notes that absence in a specific region is not a cause for concern because Google's search results will adapt to the user?s geographical location.",2,17,2023-03-24 17:28:03

This means ensuring that the title and description of your website accurately reflect who you are, what you do, and who your audience is. You can control what Google shows in the search results by using meta titles and descriptions on your website.

Jason also points out the importance of well-organized content within your website for Google to display Rich Sitelinks. Rich Sitelinks are the Blue Links with accompanying text that lead to pages such as Contact, Newsletter, Blog, and About Us. These Sitelinks help users navigate your website and are a part of your brand message. If your website is poorly organized, Google may not display these Sitelinks, which means your brand message could be lost.

Finally, Jason emphasizes that your brand message is not just for potential customers, but also for existing clients who may be navigating to your website via Google. Ensuring a positive experience for these users starts from the moment they search for your brand name. Therefore, it's important to make sure that your website accurately reflects your brand message and reputation in the eyes of your clients. Overall, the message is simple: start with what you can control, which is your website, and make sure it accurately reflects your brand message.","Jason Barnard underscores that projecting your brand's message via Google begins with the initial search a user performs for your brand name. This involves making sure that your website's title and description vividly encapsulate who you are, what you provide, and the audience you cater to. You can steer what details Google displays in search results by leveraging meta titles and descriptions on your site. Jason also highlights the significance of having methodically arranged content on your website, so Google can exhibit Rich Sitelinks. These are the Blue Links, accompanied by descriptive text, that guide users to pages like Contact, Newsletter, Blog, and About Us. Such Sitelinks facilitate website navigation and form a part of your brand communication. Without a well-structured website, Google might not showcase these Sitelinks, potentially causing your brand message to be overlooked. Lastly, Jason emphasizes that your brand message targets not only prospective customers but also existing clients who might access your website through Google. Guaranteeing a positive experience for these users commences from the very instant they look up your brand name. As such, ensuring that your website is an accurate reflection of your brand image and reputation is pivotal for your clients' perception. In a nutshell, the directive is clear: begin with what's within your control, namely your website, and ensure it accurately mirrors your brand message.",2,17,2023-03-22 12:41:06

He advises individuals to detach themselves from their company and to establish their own entity outside of it. People who solely rely on their company or a Wikipedia Page as a reference to themselves, allow Google to decide what is true about them. Jason suggests that individuals should take proactive control of their online reputation and communicate to Google the correct understanding of themselves as a named entity.","Jason Barnard underscores the importance of time and diligence in managing one's online reputation. He advises individuals to create a distinct identity separate from their company, rather than relying solely on their company or a Wikipedia Page to represent them online.

If Google doesn't explicitly understand who you are through the Knowledge Graph, it can't relate your expertise or anything that proves your authoritativeness or trustworthiness to you as an entity. Even though Google can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to guess the entity, it can dampen the EAT signals if it's only guessing and doesn't have an explicit understanding of the entity.

Jason also mentions that Google is building entities into the algorithm more and more. Companies that have a solid entity identity seem to do better, although there is no data to prove this. Therefore, it's important to think beyond just links and consider your entity's understanding so that Google can correctly apply the EAT signals. He has been thinking a lot about this topic recently and emphasizes that it's a task that we all need to do to ensure a positive and accurate representation of our brand message in the Google search results.","Jason Barnard underscores the necessity of Google comprehending who you are as an entity for the successful application of EAT (Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness) indicators. If your entity is not explicitly discernable to Google via the Knowledge Graph, it cannot link any evidence of your expertise, authority, or trustworthiness to your entity. While Google can resort to Natural Language Processing (NLP) to perceive the entity, it may mitigate the EAT signals if its understanding is predicated on conjecture rather than explicit knowledge of the entity. Jason also notes an increasing integration of entities within Google's algorithm. Firms with robust entity identities appear to fare better, notwithstanding the lack of corroborating data. Hence, it's crucial to shift focus beyond solely links and ponder your understanding of your entity to enable Google to accurately employ the EAT signals. Recently, this subject has occupied much of Jason's thoughts, and he emphasizes its importance for us all in securing a positive and precise portrayal of our brand message in Google search results.",2,17,2023-03-30 17:14:37

He explains that allowing other people, such as marketing personnel, to write for the brand can result in a lack of consistency in the message and brand representation. This inconsistency can be reflected in the brand's search engine results page (SERP), which is how Google perceives the brand.

Jason also highlights that Google is constantly evaluating a brand's credibility, expertise, authority, and trustworthiness. In order to achieve a strong brand SERP, a brand must be authentic, expert, authoritative, and trustworthy. This can be achieved by being involved in the writing process, investing time and effort in crafting an authentic message that accurately represents the brand, and staying on topic.

Overall, Jason stresses the importance of maintaining consistency and authenticity in a brand's message in order to achieve a positive brand SERP that accurately reflects the brand's image and values.","Jason Barnard underscores the necessity of maintaining coherence while formulating a brand's message. He suggests that letting others, such as marketing staff, pen the brand's content may lead to inconsistencies in the conveyed message and brand portrayal. This inconsistency could manifest in the brand's search engine results page (SERP) - Google's impression of the brand. Jason also points out that Google is persistently assessing a brand's credibility, expertise, authority, and trust. To secure a robust brand SERP, a brand needs to exhibit authenticity, expertise, authority, and reliability. This can be accomplished by engaging in the writing process, dedicating time and energy into creating a genuine message that accurately depicts the brand, and adhering to the topic.

Kalicube Pro is a platform that can help find all of the resources that Google uses for knowledge and list them by priority, so you can correct them and make your brand more consistent. This is helpful for Google as it takes time for the search engine to adapt to changes in brand information. Like a child, once Google has learned a brand name, it takes time for it to adapt to new or additional information.","Jason Barnard underscores the necessity of upholding brand consistency across all platforms for enhanced visibility on Google. He advocates for the use of Kalicube Pro, a platform designed to identify and prioritise all the resources employed by Google for acquiring knowledge so that discrepancies can be rectified and brand consistency can be bolstered.

He explains that Google's aim with the Knowledge Panel is to summarize a brand, company, person, podcast, music album, or music group by pulling information from various sources around the web. The idea is to make it easier for users to collect information without having to navigate different sites. If the Knowledge Panel is not present or has little information, it means that Google has not understood the brand, and it needs to be educated. Educating Google involves explaining the facts to the search engine so that it can understand who the brand is, what it does, and who its audience is.

Jason also explains that having a Wikipedia Page or being famous is not a requirement for having a Knowledge Panel. Google does not care if the brand is famous; it only wants to understand it. Google has an immense capacity for learning and a thirst for knowledge, making it essential to have a Knowledge Panel. Finally, he discusses the importance of Rich Elements, which are new search features such as Video Carousels, Video Boxes, Image Carousels, and Twitter boxes, and how they can be utilized to increase a brand's visibility on Google.","Jason Barnard underscores the need for a Google Knowledge Panel. He clarifies how this panel functions as a roundup of a company, individual, podcast, music album, or music group by collating information from different web sources. The intent is to simplify the user's task of gathering information without having to visit multiple websites. If the Knowledge Panel is either missing or offers sparse information, it's a signal that Google hasn't adequately understood the entity, which necessitates additional education. Educating Google entails outlining key facts about the entity, including its nature, offerings, and target audience, to the search engine. Importantly, Jason notes that possessing a Wikipedia page or achieving fame isn't a prerequisite for securing a Knowledge Panel. Google's focus is on comprehending the entity, irrespective of its notoriety. Given Google's extensive learning capacity and eagerness for knowledge, gaining a Knowledge Panel is vital.

He conducts experiments on himself and his entities to understand how Google ranks them. Despite being a digital marketer, Google associates Jason with being a British musician because of the extensive music-related content available on various platforms that Google relies on. The Blue Link algorithm correctly identifies him as a digital marketer, but the Knowledge Panel displays all aspects of his career, including music. To correct this, Jason is building a section on his personal website that highlights his career as a digital marketer and includes links to all the resources where he's cited, even if there's no Backlink.

By pointing to resources that cite him, even without Backlinks, Jason has improved the ranking of his videos and articles on his site. Google needs to be reassured and educated like a child, according to Jason. By linking to his cited content and confirming that it is him, Jason is building Google's confidence in his online presence. Ultimately, citation is a crucial element of building a strong online presence, and it is essential to consider Google's perspective when optimizing for search results.","Jason Barnard underscores the relevance of citations in creating a robust online presence. He engages in experiments that involve himself and his entities to gain a deep understanding of Google's ranking methodology. Surprisingly, Google identifies him as a British musician, even though he's a digital marketer by profession. This is due to a flood of music-related content about him on different platforms that Google employs. While Google's Blue Link algorithm correctly spots him as a digital marketer, the Knowledge Panel reflects the varied aspects of his career, inclusive of music. To rectify this, Jason is developing a section on his personal website that underscores his career as a digital marketer, furnished with links pointing to every resource that cites him, irrespective of the presence or absence of a Backlink. By directing to resources citing him, regardless of whether they have Backlinks or not, Jason has managed to enhance his site's ranking of his videos and articles. Jason likens Google to a child in terms of patience and reassurance. By linking to his cited content and validating his association with it, Jason is boosting Google's trust in his online presence.

He emphasizes the importance of being credible and sticking to generally accepted definitions when creating content. However, credibility doesn't always mean having to look to big sites. Instead, you should focus on your niche and your region's topical and geographical relevance. Jason gives the example of a poodle parlour in Paris, which doesn't need an article in the New York Times to establish its credibility. Instead, it needs to align with the poodle association of France and other dog hair clipping salons in its street to be considered credible. Therefore, businesses should aim for credibility within their niche and geo-region rather than trying to compete with larger sites.","Jason Barnard underscores the relevance of credibility in demonstrating expertise and authority to Google. He stresses the necessity to adhere to generally accepted definitions when producing content, while maintaining credibility. However, credibility is not synonymous with referencing large platforms. Instead, businesses should concentrate on their respective niche and the significance of their local region. Using the illustration of a Parisian poodle salon, Jason indicates it doesn't require an endorsement from the New York Times to gain credibility. Rather, alignment with the Poodle Association of France and neighboring dog grooming parlors would be more valid. Therefore, he advises businesses to strive for niche and regionally specific credibility, instead of endeavouring to rival larger platforms.",2,17,2023-02-28 13:56:02

He believes that talking about what audiences see when they search for a brand name is crucial in increasing awareness of the concept. Despite being a new concept, Jason finds it surprising that it hasn't been a focus in the past 25 years. He hopes that it will become a focus in the next 25 years.

Jason recommends his book as a comprehensive guide to understanding why Brand SERPs are important and how to build a digital marketing strategy around them. He believes that his book lays a foundation of thought and approach that can be built upon. Overall, hed advocates for increased awareness and discussion of Brand SERPs, as he considers them a vital aspect of a brand's digital presence.","Jason Barnard underscores the significance of Brand SERPs and urges greater dialogue surrounding the subject. He posits that examining what audiences discover when they search for a brand name is pivotal in augmenting the comprehension of the concept.

He emphasizes that Google's perception of an individual is a reflection of the world's perception, and losing focus on exact match brand search can be detrimental. He gives an example of Ben Shapiro, an American commentator, who made the mistake of allowing Google to believe that Twitter was the best representative of his entity instead of having a website to represent him.

Jason suggests that Benjamin Shapiro, who shares the same name as the commentator, has a lot of possibilities to develop his SERP and share it with the commentator. He also recommends adding a middle initial to disambiguate search results. Ultimately, the key is to ensure that Google is sure that it is searching for the specific person.","Jason Barnard underscores the significance of exact match brand search while distinguishing it from branded search. He underlines that an individual's image on Google mirrors the world's view, implying that ignoring exact match brand search can be costly. He cites an example involving Ben Shapiro, an American commentator, who erred by letting Google perceive Twitter as the prime platform representing his persona, rather than creating a personal website to reflect his entity. Jason hints that someone named Benjamin Shapiro, sharing the same name as the commentator, possesses ample opportunities to carve out his SERP and vie with the commentator. He further proposes adding a middle initial to dispel any confusion in the search results. Essentially, it's critically important to ensure Google understands that it's retrieving results for a specific individual.",2,17,2023-03-30 13:42:46
859,Transcript,,The Importance of Semantic HTML 5 for Passage-Based Indexing and Structuring Content,"Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of using HTML 5 for structuring content. He mentions a tool on Kalicube Pro that can analyze a page and break it down into its structural components, such as the header, main section, article, and aside. By using semantic HTML 5, the machine can identify where to find the main content and differentiate it from other helpful but non-essential information. Jason also explains that Google is now using passage-based indexing, which means it can take any passage and use it independently of the rest of the content. To take advantage of this, it is essential to structure content using HTML 5.

Jason demonstrates the importance of proper HTML 5 structure by using Cadence as an example of a page that has not been structured effectively. He shows that by changing just one setting, the H1 heading, which is the heading of the whole page or the heading of the article, can be placed outside of the main part. This causes confusion for Google because it thinks this is something separate when it is not. By separating the top part from the rest of the content, the green line separates it from the main chunk.

In conclusion, Jason emphasizes that semantic HTML 5 is vital for structuring content effectively. Google's passage-based indexing now allows it to use any passage independently of the rest of the content, so it is crucial to use HTML 5 to differentiate the main content from other helpful but non-essential information. By properly structuring content, it is easier for the machine to identify where to find the main content and create featured snippets or results.","Jason Barnard underscores the significance of leveraging HTML 5 in order to effectively structure content. He refers to a specific tool on the Kalicube Pro platform, explaining how it possesses the capability to critically analyze a page and decompose it into its intrinsic structural elements which include the header, main section, article, and aside. The application of semantic HTML 5 facilitates machine comprehension, enabling it to locate the core content efficiently while simultaneously distinguishing it from other valuable yet non-critical data. Jason further elucidates that Google has now incorporated passage-based indexing in its system. This means Google has the ability to extract any given passage and utilize it independently from the overall content. This development necessitates the call for structured content using HTML 5. Jason exemplifies the importance of proper HTML 5 structure by using Cadence as a case study of a less-effectively structured webpage. By tweaking just a single setting, the H1 heading which designates the entire page or article heading, can be misplaced outside the main section and consequently may be misinterpreted by Google as an independent entity. This subdivision of the introductory part from the rest of the content ends up segregating the main chunk from the page. To conclude, Jason re-emphasizes the critical role of semantic HTML 5 in creating a coherent content structure. Considering Google's adoption of passage-based indexing, it is paramount to embrace HTML 5 to clearly demarcate the crux of the content from other supporting yet non-essential details. By arranging content/guidance structurally, machines are better equipped to identify the crucial information required to generate featured snippets or results.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:42:34
857,Transcript,,Writing Less and Summarizing More: Why Shorter Articles with Clear Summaries are More Effective for Retaining Information,"Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of micro semantics in writing. He defines micro semantics as thinking about related terms that may not be immediately obvious but make sense within the context of the topic. He believes that incorporating these terms in articles will make them more detailed and informative. Jason also admits to the habit of rephrasing and adding details to his writing, which he believes is important in conveying the right message to the audience.

Jason also stresses the importance of brevity in writing. He believes that shorter articles are easier to read, digest, and retain. He argues that reducing the length of an article can actually make it more effective as it forces the writer to be more efficient with their language. To this end, Jason suggests starting articles with a summary of what the reader will learn. This summary should go at the top of the article to help readers quickly understand the article's content.

Overall, Jason emphasizes the importance of finding a balance between detail and brevity in writing. He suggests incorporating micro semantics to make articles more detailed and informative while starting articles with a summary to ensure brevity and clarity.","Jason Barnard underscores the significance of micro semantics in content crafting, which he explains as the inclusion of tangentially related yet contextually suitable terms that might not be inherently evident. He posits that such terms, when woven into articles, enhance the details and informational value. Jason has a regular practice of revising and adding specifics to his content, a process he considers vital for effectively communicating with audiences. Alongside depth, he stresses the need for conciseness in writing, maintaining that more digestible, compact articles enhance reader engagement and information retention. He contends that condensing an article can enhance its impact as it necessitates more efficient use of language. Consequently, Jason advocates for prefacing articles with a brief overview, allowing readers to rapidly grasp the contents. In summary, he accentuates the necessity of striking a balance between comprehensive detail, achieved through the use of micro semantics, and conciseness, achieved by prefacing articles with a summary.",2,17,2023-03-31 17:26:01
855,Transcript,,"Prioritizing Depth, Velocity, and Breadth for Effective Content Strategy","According to Jason Barnard, their company aims to maintain a consistent inconsistency in publishing content regularly, which is important for keeping their brand visible and ranking high on Google. This means publishing on different days at different times, which creates an inconsistency that Google will still recognize as regular publishing. They believe that maintaining a consistent publishing velocity is key to maintaining momentum and Google ranking. They prioritize depth, velocity, and breadth in their content strategy. Depth is important for Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, breadth is for SEO, and velocity is for the number of articles they can regularly maintain.

Their priority is to first establish depth, followed by velocity and breadth. They prioritize depth in Brand SERPs, Knowledge Panels, and Knowledge Algorithms, and breadth in SEO. They believe that increasing velocity can be achieved by putting more effort into writing better quality or more sales-driven content. The idea is to keep increasing the publishing velocity either in quality or quantity. Maintaining this consistent velocity helps to establish their brand and maintain their ranking on Google.","Jason Barnard underscores their company's commitment to upholding a consistently inconsistent content publication rhythm, which crucially contributes to their brand's visibility and high Google ranking. This entails disseminating content not on fixed days or times, creating a pattern of inconsistency that Google interprets as regular publishing nonetheless. They assert that preserving a steady publishing velocity is crucial to maintaining momentum and sustaining high rankings on Google. In their content strategy, they focus on three aspects: depth, velocity, and breadth. Depth pertains to Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, breadth to SEO, and velocity to the frequency of publication. Their strategy involves establishing depth before scaling velocity and breadth. They focus on depth within Brand SERPs, Knowledge Panels, and Knowledge Algorithms, while breadth is prioritized in SEO. They suggest that enhancing velocity can be achieved through greater efforts in crafting superior quality or sales-oriented content. The aim is to continually accelerate the publishing velocity either in terms of quality or quantity.

He notes that when he searches in French, the restaurant's website ranks first and they have several positive reviews. The restaurant's Google Business Profile on the right-hand side also looks great.

However, when he searches in English, the restaurant loses the top spot on the search results page. This means that they lose control over their Brand SERP for tourists in Paris who are likely to search in English. To remedy this, Jason suggests that Indian Swad create an English version of their website so that English-speaking people searching for Indian food or restaurants in Paris can easily find them and they can attract clients who speak both French and English.

Jason's analysis highlights the importance of catering to different languages and audiences when it comes to online presence and Brand SERP management. By creating an English version of their website, Indian Swad can potentially improve their online visibility and attract more customers, regardless of their language preference.","Jason Barnard undertakes an analysis of The Brand SERP for Indian Swad, an Indian eatery in Paris. He observes that their website secures the top ranking and boasts several positive reviews when searched in French. Their Google Business Profile on the right side also presents an impressive outlook. However, the search in English tells a different story, as the restaurant drops from the premiere spot on the SERP. This shift could mean a loss of control over their Brand SERP among Paris tourists, who are more likely to conduct searches in English. To overcome this, Jason proposes that Indian Swad should develop an English version of their website. This would facilitate easy discovery for English-speaking individuals looking for Indian cuisine in Paris and attract patrons fluent in both French and English.

However, he suggests that businesses should be looking at the Brand SERP proactively, using SEO techniques to solve reputation situations before they become a problem. By doing so, businesses can proactively prove to Google that they are an expert, authority, and trustworthy brand in their area, which is known as E.A.T.

Jason believes that the Brand SERP is a representation of Google's opinion of the world's opinion of a brand, and it provides a window into what Google thinks about a business. He recommends that businesses build their digital strategy from the Brand SERP outwards, as Google is showing them what it likes, what it doesn't like, and what it thinks is relevant and valuable to their audience. By doing so, businesses can prioritize their content and see where their priorities lie in terms of what Google has understood, what people think about them, and what content is relevant, helpful, and valuable to their audience.

Overall, Jason's approach is to use the Brand SERP as a foundation for building a strong SEO and digital strategy, and to view it as an opportunity to proactively improve a business's reputation and demonstrate its expertise, authority, and trustworthiness to Google.","Jason Barnard views the Brand SERP as more than a reputation management concern, regarding it as a focal point to proactively apply SEO techniques to enhance reputation standing before it becomes an issue. It enables businesses to pre-emptively establish their E.A.T (Expertise, Authority, Trustworthiness) status on Google. In Jason's view, the Brand SERP reflects Google's perspective of public opinion on a brand, offering insight into Google's interpretation of the business. He advises building a digital strategy rooted in Brand SERP, since Google highlights preferences, dislikes, and perceived relevance for the audience in it. Consequently, businesses can arrange their content priorities based on what Google comprehends about them, public opinion, and the content considered significant, helpful, and of value to their audience. To conclude, Jason encourages leveraging Brand SERP as a cornerstone to build influential SEO and digital strategies, considering it an opportunity to proactively boost a business's reputation and exhibit its expertise, authority, and trustworthiness to Google.",2,17,2023-03-22 09:53:07

Jason says that he has not yet found a topic where he cannot use this analogy to help explain and make it easier to understand. He believes that major tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, and Microsoft are all creating machines that aim to understand the world and serve their users, audiences, and clients, just like a child would try to help its parents.

Jason has been using this analogy for a long time, and he recalls using it in his first-ever conference talk back in 2015. While people applauded him for his presentation, they did not fully understand it. He realized that he needed to simplify his explanation of the analogy to help people better understand it.

Jason emphasizes the importance of understanding who your audience is and how to make friends with the right people. He suggests that once you understand who your audience is, you can start to ask the child analogy questions to better understand how Google perceives you and your website. This will help you determine which search queries your website appears for, which in turn will help you understand the words your audience is using to search for your website.","Jason Barnard, a tech industry expert, uses the child analogy as a strategic device to simplify and articulate varied complex subjects in technology. He asserts that emerging machines from big tech companies like Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter, are striving to make sense of the world and serve their users - similar to a child desiring to assist their parents. Jason has chosen the child metaphor for years, starting from his initial conference speech back in 2015. Although the presentation received positive feedback, listeners struggled to fully comprehend it, leading him to further streamline his explanation of the metaphor. Critical to successfully implementing this child metaphor, according to Jason, is identifying your audience and building connections with the right individuals. Once you understand your audience, you can use the metaphor like a tool to understand how Google views you and your website, discover your website's search queries, and ultimately understand the exact language your audience uses to find you.",2,17,2023-04-03 13:35:50

He explained that if a social media platform is not ranking on a SERP, it could be a sign that the strategy on that platform is not working. He advised businesses to consider why their audience is not engaging on the platform or why Google cannot recognize the engagement. He also noted that different social media platforms tend to dominate in different industries, and businesses should focus their efforts on the platforms that are relevant to their audience.

Jason also discussed Knowledge Panels and their role in corroborating information about a company or entity. He explained that Knowledge Panels can vary in content from country to country, depending on the audience and Google's Knowledge Panel progress. He added that repeating the same information in a Knowledge Panel multiple times can have diminishing returns, and businesses need to provide third-party news and information to maintain confirmation of their entity's credibility.

In conclusion, Jason emphasized the importance of a well-rounded digital marketing strategy that includes a targeted social media presence and diverse sources of information to corroborate a company's credibility on search engine results pages.","Jason Barnard, also dubbed The Brand SERP Guy, shared his perspectives on the significance of social media links within Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs), and how they can serve as a gauge for the success of a social media strategy. He suggested that the lack of a specific social media platform ranking on a SERP might signal a need to revise the strategy implemented on that platform. Businesses should scrutinize why their audience is under-engaged on that platform or why Google isn't acknowledging this engagement. Barnard also observed that certain social media platforms dominate distinct industries, hence businesses should streamline their efforts towards platforms that resonate with their particular audience. In addition, Jason explored the role of Knowledge Panels in validating information about a firm or entity. He clarified that these panels can vary in content across countries, dependent on the specific audience and the state of Google's Knowledge Panel evolution in that country. He added that over-repetition of identical information within a Knowledge Panel can lead to a plateau in returns. Therefore, businesses should ensure diverse third-party news and information sources to sustain the confirmation of their entity's credibility.

However, it may not be triggered for users with navigational intent, such as those simply searching for a specific website.

Feeling Curious was discovered and demonstrated by Brian Freiesleben, who shared a video of the feature. Jason speculates that if Google does roll out this new element, it could be a valuable addition for lesser-known brands that people are trying to learn about.

He describes a sprout as a tiny Knowledge Panel with small roots that is vulnerable to being blown away by the wind. To nurture the sprout, he suggests that people need to help the roots grow and strengthen so that the sprout can become a full-grown plant that will appear on the right-hand rail of Google's search results.

Jason warns that people often stop at the sprout stage and fail to nurture it, which can lead to the sprout being blown away by a gust of wind. Google wants to avoid putting incorrect information on its platform, so it needs to be sure that the information it presents is accurate. Therefore, if a contradiction arises, Google may remove the sprout from the Knowledge Panel to avoid misleading users. Jason's message is clear: to prevent your sprout from being blown away, it is essential to strengthen the roots by providing accurate and relevant information.","Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", introduces the concept of a ""sprout"" pertaining to Google's Knowledge Panel. In his analogy, a sprout represents a budding Knowledge Panel with delicate roots, susceptible to being swept away by even the gentlest breeze. To nurture this sprout into a resilient tree displayed on Google's right-hand search results side bar, consistent and attentive care must be extended to help the roots deepen and strengthen. Jason emphasizes a common oversight; many individuals halt their efforts upon sprout emergence, causing it to easily be taken by the wind. Owing to Google's commitment to prevent erroneous information dissemination, it ensures information accuracy prior to presentation. Consequently, when confronted with contradicting information, Google might elect removal of the sprout from the Knowledge Panel to preclude potential user deception. Jason's advice is explicit: to safeguard your sprout against breezes, it is essential to fortify the roots by furnishing precise, pertinent information.",2,17,2023-02-27 14:32:51

He emphasizes the importance of Brand SERPs as a business card and a chance to make a positive impression on people. He explains that when people search for his personal or company name, what appears on the Brand SERP is ""phenomenally important"" and has an opportunity to make new friends or customers.

Jason's obsession with Brand SERPs is driven by his belief that they are crucial for businesses since those who search for a brand name are already at the bottom of the funnel and close to converting. He highlights that his job is to help brands make sure their Brand SERPs reflect positively on their business and that the content is relevant, helpful, and informative. He considers that there is an excellent opportunity to make a positive impression on those who search for a brand name and that businesses should seize that opportunity to gain more friends or customers.","Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", is an expert in optimizing what is displayed when someone Google searches a brand's name, also known as a Brand SERP.

When individuals search either for Jason's own name or his business name, he pays special attention to what pops up in his Brand SERP, considering this to be incredibly crucial. The reason behind his fixation on this is because he sees those who are actively searching for a brand's name as already being near the conversion stage, thus making that first impression significantly impactful. Therefore, his role is to assist businesses in ensuring their Brand SERPs project a positive and accurate image of their company with relevant and useful content.

Although it can usually piece them together correctly, there are times when it is a big mess or Google gets it wrong. To help the child, we as responsible adults must teach it about a specific corner of the internet, provide a reference for comparison (reconciliation), guide it to reliable and authoritative sources, and show it what is true and what is not. Just like a child asking a history teacher for information on history or a baker for information on bread, authoritative sources are crucial and must be consistent and corroborated to build the child's confidence in understanding the reconciled puzzle.","Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", presents an analogy likening Google's learning process to a child trying to piece together a broken puzzle from fragments scattered all over the internet. Often, Google can fit these pieces together accurately, but at times, it ends up with a chaotic mess or incorrect information. To assist this 'child', our role as knowledgeable adults is to educate it about our specific corner of the internet, offer a referential framework for comparison (which Barnard refers to as 'reconciliation'), guide the 'child' towards trustworthy and authoritative sources, and distinguish between what is truthful and what isn't. Much as how a child would rely on a history teacher for historical knowledge or a baker for insights on bread-making, the presence of authoritative sources that offer consistent and corroborated information is critical for building Google's confidence in its understanding of this reconciled digital puzzle.",2,17,2023-02-14 15:12:41

Jason explains that he has a database of 70,000 entities, 10 million Brand SERPs, and 15 million Knowledge Graph entries, which he stores in a large database. He further explains that he has found a new way to track updates and potentially what they mean, that the two algorithms for the Knowledge Graph and Brand SERP are merging, and that new information is crucial to a strong Knowledge Graph presence.

Jason Barnard goes on to describe a eureka moment he had when he discovered how to track these updates and their effects on Knowledge Graph presence. He notes that the work he does with Hollywood stars, which involves standardizing information around them, greatly affects their Knowledge Graph presence. He suggests that this understanding is crucial because Google loves fresh information and that the competition to maintain a strong Knowledge Graph presence is intense.

Barnard also mentions his innovative approach to tracking updates and understanding their implications, observing a merging trend between the two algorithms for the Knowledge Graph and Brand SERPs. The addition of fresh information, he underscores, is vital for a robust Knowledge Graph presence. Barnard's work standardizing information around Hollywood stars, he notes, significantly impacts their Knowledge Graph presence due to Google's preference for up-to-date data.

410,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/corporation/kingston/,"Google?s Implicit Understanding of the Branded Search Term, Kingston","Jason Barnard (The Brand SERP Guy) investigates the Brand SERP for Kingston. Now he's a bit of a geek. So Jason assumes it's Kingston, the technology company, but since he's searching London, Google fills in some blanks and gives him a lot of Kingston upon Thames. Jason thought that was bad until he saw that it could be places, animals, music, people, rivers, and other uses. There are many different uses for Kingston, but Google in the UK is still leading with this idea. Then Jason looked at the US, and they have the Knowledge Panel. That's great, but they also have the big map pack. They also think it's a city. There are a lot of questions about it. There are a lot of places that are incredibly unclear and hard for Kingston to control.

Jason points out that when you're planning your company name, you should be very careful about Google's implicit understanding of the intent of a key word beyond the simple, exact meaning of the word, which hopefully is your brand. In short, what happened here was the majority of results in both the right and left rails are irrelevant to the brand. The implicit understanding of cities ruins the SERP downstream. The big lesson here is to be very careful when naming your brand to avoid these misunderstandings.","Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"","" researches Brand SERP for Kingston. As a tech enthusiast, Jason instinctively associates Kingston with the well-known tech company. However, as his search location is London, Google enters many references to Kingston upon Thames. At first Jason found this confusing, but on closer inspection he realised that Kingston can refer to a variety of things, including places, animals, music, people and rivers. Despite this range of possible interpretations, Google UK continues to lean towards the geographical connotation. When Jason takes a closer look at Google US, he finds that while there is an informative Knowledge Panel, there is also an extensive map package that indicates that Google identifies Kingston as a city. This raises a number of questions and ambiguities that are difficult for Kingston to clarify. Jason stresses the importance of being proactive and careful when naming a business, as Google understands the potential intent of a keyword, which usually goes beyond the literal definition, which should ideally be consistent with your brand. Unfortunately, in this case, the majority of results on both the right and left hand sides of the SERP have nothing to do with Kingston, the brand - a problem caused primarily by implicit geographical associations. In summary, this research shows above all the importance of careful naming of the brand ",2,17,2023-02-22 09:31:29

According to Barnard, the first step is to examine your Brand SERP and review what you see and what you expected to see - typically they are not identical.

He also highlighted that the Google Brand SERP is the new business card and the first impression of your brand.

Jason explained that it is crucial to manage and optimize your Brand SERP because it is the first impression that counts, and it is not advisable to let Google decide what it shows on your Brand SERP. He likened letting Google decide what to display on your Brand SERP to letting your mother dress you for a cool party, which can lead to a negative first impression and missed opportunities.

He notes that although he previously predicted the demise of Blue Links, Frdric Dubut from Bing informed him that the number of Blue Links has remained stable over the past few years. However, rich elements such as Video Boxes, Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes, and People Also Ask Boxes have become more prevalent in SERPs. According to Jason's research, the ideal ratio of Blue Links to rich elements is approximately seven to eight Blue Links and three rich elements. A SERP containing 10 Blue Links is considered unconvincing to an audience, indicating an inadequate content strategy.

Jason also highlights the importance of considering the ambiguity of a search term when analyzing a Brand's SERP. He explains that the balance between Blue Links and rich elements can vary depending on the ambiguity of the search term. Overall, Jason emphasizes that understanding the balance between Blue Links and rich elements is crucial for brands to ensure a convincing and effective presence on search engines. He suggests that brands with an excessive number of Blue Links should reevaluate their content strategy or consider employing a content manager.","Jason Barnard, also known as ""The Brand SERP Guy,"" speaks about the critical balance between Blue Links and rich elements on a Brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP).

Instead, rich elements like Video Boxes, Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes, and People Also Ask Boxes have risen in frequency on SERPs. Jason's research pinpoints the ideal Blue Links to rich elements ratio at about seven or eight to three respectively. He argues a SERP with 10 Blue Links fails to persuade an audience and suggests a flawed content strategy. Jason also stresses the importance of account for the degree of ambiguity a search term holds when scrutinizing a Brand's SERP. He explains that a search term's ambiguity can result in variations in the balance between Blue Links and rich elements.

Initially, he had been pushing out images without much thought, but when he saw the Image Boxes on his Brand SERP, he realized that they were ugly and didn't represent him well. 

Jason emphasized the value of having a talented graphic designer and the message that a visual image can project to an audience, not just on a Brand SERP but also elsewhere. He explained that images come before words, and a consistent visual brand message is incredibly difficult to manage, even for small companies. However, he was able to replace his inconsistent visual brand message with a consistent one in about three months by making a sustained effort.

Jason's experience highlights the importance of design in creating a consistent visual brand image, and the value of having a graphic design expert. It also shows that even if a brand has previously put out an inconsistent visual message, it is not too late to make a change and create a consistent image that accurately represents the brand.","Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy and an authority in Brand SERP optimization, presented his experiences illuminating the vital role of design in crafting a consistent brand image visually.

Jason acutely emphasized the significance of an adept graphic designer, and the impression a visual image can convey to an audience - this holds true not just for a Brand SERP but in general as well. He clarified that visuals precede words, and managing a uniform visual brand message is immensely challenging, even for smaller businesses. Nonetheless, by maintaining a steady effort, he successfully transitioned from an uneven visual brand message to a cohesive one within about three months.

Instead of creating content solely for the purpose of pleasing Google, he advises businesses to focus on serving their audience by creating content that pays for itself on the platform it's on.

Jason suggests that repurposing content for Google should be seen as a bonus rather than the primary goal. By creating content that suits the audience and platform it's intended for, businesses can engage their audience and achieve their goals. If the content can be repurposed for Google, it should be viewed as a bonus that can further enhance a brand's digital presence.","Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy, advocates a targeted approach to content creation, using a vivid analogy: a cup of tea spilled from an unbalanced table. He encourages companies to tailor their content specifically to the target audience and the relevant platforms, rather than just aiming to please Google. He argues that such content is justified by the value it generates on the relevant platform, while any resulting Google optimization is a welcome bonus. Jason sees content conversion as a useful secondary goal for Google, rather than the main objective, and points out that serving the audience should come first. By creating content that appeals to the target audience and is appropriate for the intended platform, businesses can effectively engage their audience and achieve their stated goals.

He focuses specifically on the first result that appears on the page and notes that the text presented is not an effective brand message. While it includes the tagline ""TASTE THE FEELING"" and the Coca-Cola trademark, it doesn't align with Coca-Cola's global brand message. Jason explains that the issue is that Coca-Cola's homepage serves as a locator for users, but the company hasn't optimized it for Google search results. As a result, the search engine has had to use inadequate text for the SERP snippet.

Jason suggests that Coca-Cola could improve their SERP appearance by adding text to the homepage that Google can use to generate a more appropriate snippet. He also recommends that the company fill in the description in the metas to help Google display better results at the top of the SERP. At present, the title is not optimal, and the lack of description means that Google has had to rely on what little text it could find on the homepage.

Overall, Jason's analysis highlights the importance of optimizing a company's website for search engine results. Coca-Cola's failure to do so has resulted in an inadequate brand message being presented to users who search for the company's name. By taking steps to improve their website's SEO, Coca-Cola could ensure that the first impression users get when they search for the brand is a positive one.","Jason Barnard, also known as the Brand SERP Guy, critically analyzes the Brand SERP for Coca-Cola. He pinpoints their primary result on the page and observes that the text displayed falls short in delivering an effective brand message. Despite incorporating the tagline ""TASTE THE FEELING"" and the Coca-Cola trademark, the text doesn't capture Coca-Cola's overarching brand message. Jason identifies that Coca-Cola's homepage, while fulfilling its purpose as a navigational aid for users, doesn't appear to be optimized for Google search results. Consequently, the search engine has resorted to utilizing subpar text to generate the SERP snippet. He advises Coca-Cola to consider enhancing their SERP presentation by incorporating text into their homepage that Google can leverage to yield a more fitting snippet. He also advocates for the brand to engage in meta descriptions to guide Google towards showcasing a more desirable result at the top of the SERP. Currently, the title is suboptimal and the absence of a description causes Google to utilize whatever sparse text is available on the homepage. Jason's assessment underscores the significance of honing a company's website for search engine results. Coca-Cola's oversight in this aspect has culminated in an insufficient brand message being relayed to users seeking the company's name. By initiating steps to bolster their website's SEO, Coca-Cola can promise that the first imprint users receive when they search for the brand is a favorable one.",2,17,2023-02-20 12:17:27

According to Jason, Wikipedia has been used and abused by SEOs for link building, which has led to frustration from Wikipedia editors. However, Jason has found that creating entities in the Knowledge Graph without using Wikipedia or Wikidata is not very difficult, but it does take more time. He has conducted 500 experiments, with 200 not using Wiki at all and 200 in the Knowledge Graph.

Jason Barnard emphasizes the importance of corroborative information when creating an entity in the Knowledge Graph. He warns that if an entity does not have corroborative information, it will not be confident, and there will be no point in creating it. Additionally, Jason warns against relying solely on Wikipedia or Wikidata to create a Knowledge Panel. He notes that using just one of these sources can result in a flaky, unstable Knowledge Panel that can disappear at any moment. He also advises against using Wikipedia for link building purposes unless one is notable, as it is a waste of time and will likely result in a deleted article and a Knowledge Panel that disappears after a few days.

In conclusion, Jason suggests that SEOs focus on creating entities in the Knowledge Graph without relying solely on Wikipedia or Wikidata. By using corroborative information and taking the time to build a solid entity, SEOs can create a stable and long-lasting Knowledge Panel that will benefit their brand.","Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy, dives into the conduct of SEOs using Wikipedia for link building, leading to an exasperation among Wikipedia editors. He, however, points out that constructing entities within the Knowledge Graph, independent of Wikipedia or Wikidata, isn't as daunting as it appears, but it undeniably demands more time. Quoting from his pool of 500 diverse experiments, he states that 200 didn't involve Wiki whatsoever while the rest were within the ambit of the Knowledge Graph. Barnard accentuates the need for corroborative information while creating an entity in the Knowledge Graph, cautioning that the absence of such corroborating data can affect the confidence of an entity, making the creation effort void. He further advises against the singular dependence on either Wikipedia or Wikidata for generating a Knowledge Panel, alerting that this could lead to a shaky Knowledge Panel, prone to disappearing unanticipatedly. He also recommends not using Wikipedia for link building unless truly noteworthy, as it's likely to be unavailing, ending in deletion of the article and a short-lived Knowledge Panel. Culminating his discussion, Jason urges SEOs to concentrate more on crafting entities within the Knowledge Graph sans solely relying on Wikipedia or Wikidata.

When that venture ended, Jason used his experience as leverage to convince people to hire him for their businesses, claiming that if he could do that with a blue dog and a yellow koala, he could do wonders for their brand.

Jason explains that his music was heavily influenced by punk, specifically the Pogues, and that their sound was a more aggressive version of folk music. He then shifted to making children's songs before moving into SEO in 1998, which was the same year that Google was incorporated. Despite Google's success, Jason has had his own parallel path in SEO and has become a reputable figure in the industry.

He states that it's essential for the results to represent the brand or person accurately and helpfully to their intended audience, who are a subset of Google's users. In his book, ""The Fundamentals of Brand SERPs,"" Jason shares that improving the results is quite simple, starting with checking and optimizing the homepage and other pages such as the About Us and Contact Us pages, Blog Landing Pages, and product or category pages for companies. For individuals, it's their personal website or the About You page on their company website that's most likely to rank number one.

Jason suggests that changing the meta title, meta description, or content is the easiest way to improve the results, especially if using WordPress and Yoast. He also emphasizes the importance of optimizing social profiles, as they often rank highly in search results. However, he notes that third-party sites and platforms may require more time and effort to improve the search results. Still, he advises people to communicate and collaborate with the people behind those web pages, as they're often willing to help each other out.","Jason Barnard, also known as the Brand SERP Guy, emphasizes that the search results displayed when someone searches for a specific brand or an individual's name should honestly and effectively represent the respective entity to their target audience.

It starts with examining and fine-tuning the homepage, and extends to other pages like 'About Us', 'Contact Us', and 'Blog Landing Pages' for businesses, or personal websites and 'About You' pages on company websites for individuals.

He suggests that there are always opportunities for improvement, even if a website is well-optimized. For instance, contact pages, which are typically overlooked in traditional SEO strategies, can be critical in the sitelinks section of a brand's search engine results page (SERP). This section is front and center and may be the first thing people see when searching for a brand, making it crucial to present a positive and accurate image.

Jason advises that after optimizing what a business can control, it should look into what it can semi-control, such as social media accounts, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, and Wikidata. He also suggests that businesses should aim to obtain rich elements such as Video Boxes, which can provide insights into a brand's marketing strategy. However, if a business does not have these rich elements, it may be an indication that its marketing strategy needs improvement.

Jason stresses that a brand's SERP is an excellent indicator of its digital ecosystem and marketing strategy. It is essential for businesses to take control of how they are presented to existing and potential clients, journalists, partners, and employees. By presenting a positive image and optimizing their digital presence, businesses can attract the right clients, partners, and employees and differentiate themselves from their competitors.","Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy, encourages businesses to perform a self-search on their brands and critically examine the resulting search outcomes. He suggests that even for well-optimized websites, there's always room for betterment. For example, the seldom-optimized contact pages could play a pivotal role in the sitelinks section of a brand's search engine results page (SERP), which often appears at the forefront and might be the initial encounter people have while searching for a brand, emphasizing the need for it to depict a positive and authentic image. Post optimization of controllable aspects, Jason's advice transitions to focusing on what can be semi-controlled, such as social media profiles, Crunchbase, Wikipedia, and Wikidata. Aiming for rich elements like Video Boxes may offer insightful glimpses into a brand's marketing approach. However, the absence of these rich features could be a red flag indicating that the marketing strategy requires refinements. Jason underscores that a brand's SERP acts as a reliable barometer of its digital ecosystem and the effectiveness of its marketing maneuvers. It's crucial for businesses to grasp how they appear to their current and prospective clients, journalists, associates, and personnel. By showcasing a positive image and optimizing their digital footprint, businesses can entice the right clientele, collaborators, and workforce, effectively setting themselves apart from competitors.",2,17,2023-02-15 14:14:54

However, he points out that Google has made a mistake in the Knowledge Panel by focusing on ""Timpson's Shoe Repairs in the Ridings Shopping Center"" instead of the company's official name, Timpson.

Jason goes on to explain that there must be some information out there that has caused this confusion and that Timpson needs to find out where it comes from and correct it. By doing so, they can improve their brand image and make themselves look more professional. The machine will then correct the title in the knowledge panel to represent the company with the correct name.

According to Jason, they have an absolutely delightful brand SERP and are doing incredibly well. They have almost done a Disney.

Jason defines ""doing a Disney"" as a type of brand SERP where the brand has full control over all the blue links on the first page. Characteristic are links from different domains owned by the same company. A derivation from the proper name Walt Disney Company.

He mentioned that it just means that the blue link is owned by them. They have four bluelinks and almost all of them are Hallmark and they could very easily do a Disney because those links show what they are. So all they would have to do is put some other content on the first page to replace Wikipedia and Facebook and they would have done a Disney.","Jason Barnard, also known as 'The Brand SERP Guy', gives a glowing review of Hallmark's Brand SERP. With impressive control over the Brand SERP, Hallmark almost achieves what he calls 'doing a Disney'. Jason explains this concept as a scenario where one brand manages to dominate all blue links on the first SERP, with links from different domains all belonging to the same company. In Hallmark's case, almost all of the four blue links come exclusively from Hallmark. This means that they take up most of the search results and effectively reflect the Hallmark brand. According to Jason, to achieve a full 'Disney', Hallmark would simply need to replace some of the other content, such as the Wikipedia and Facebook links on the first page, with its own. Once this is done, Hallmark would have successfully 'Disneyed"" and gained full control of its Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-02-22 02:56:29

The Brand SERP Guy (Jason Barnard): Because SEO traditionally is I want to rank number one to get the traffic, but having your site at number one is the absolute minimum in terms of when somebody searches your brand name. And if you?re not doing that, you really haven?t done your job. But then you have to think about the rest of that page. What message does it convey to your audience? Is it positive? Is it accurate?

During the editing process, Jason realized that what he thought was obvious and straightforward to marketers and brand managers was not clear to them. Emily had misconceptions and misunderstandings, so they worked together to make the book accessible to everyone.

He compared this process to parenting a child, where the goal is to provide clear and consistent information from trusted sources. The first step, he noted, is to correct any existing confusion or fragmentation in one's online presence. From there, the focus should be on identifying and leveraging authoritative sources for the specific topic or genre.

Jason emphasized that this approach is not complicated or technical. In fact, he believes it is ""idiotically simple"" and accessible to anyone. He plans to write a book, create courses, and build a SaaS platform to help people implement these ideas. He cited a recent consulting session with an author as an example of how effective this approach can be.

According to Jason, optimizing Rich Sitelinks involves ensuring that Google understands the content of the page, including the meta title, and meta description. He emphasized the importance of semantic HTML5, which is often overlooked, but Bingbot loves it. Using semantic HTML5 on typical pages that appear on Rich Sitelinks, such as the Homepage, Contact Page, About Page, Profile Page, Pricing, and Blog, can help with schema markup and ultimately improve search rankings.

When it comes to Image Boxes, Jason noted that they look pretty and can improve search rankings, but it's crucial to ensure that the images are of high quality and optimized for SEO, including alt tags, filenames, titles, captions, and semantic HTML5. Additionally, Google tends to test new rich elements in the US and the UK, so there may be fewer Image Boxes in those regions. However, if images are relevant and helpful to the audience, such as in the housing industry or real estate, they tend to appear more frequently.

Lastly, Jason emphasized the importance of a consistent brand image and distributing images across trusted sources, as Google tends not to show images just from the brand's site on the Brand SERP. By having a consistent brand image across all channels, including social media and other online platforms, businesses can improve their chances of appearing in Image Boxes and Rich Sitelinks on Google.","Jason Barnard, also known as The Brand SERP Guy, provides guidance on how to enhance Rich Sitelinks, Image Boxes, and Brand SERPs for optimum performance. For Rich Sitelinks, Jason recommends ensuring Google comprehends the page's content along with its meta title and description. He gives special importance to semantic HTML5, an often-unnoticed aspect but highly appreciated by Bingbot. He advises its application on common pages that are credited in Rich Sitelinks such as the Homepage, Contact Page, About Page, Profile Page, Pricing, and Blog. Successfully using this can aid schema markup and eventually boost search rankings. With regards to Image Boxes, Jason confirms their aesthetic appeal and contribution to better search rankings, but asserts the necessity to optimize the images with high-quality SEO practices. This involves including alt tags, filenames, titles, captions, and the use of semantic HTML5. Additionally, he observes that Google often runs trials of new rich elements in regions like the US and UK, which might result in fewer Image Boxes. However, images gain greater prominence when they are helpful and relevant to users, as seen in industries such as real estate. Lastly, he underscores the significance of maintaining a consistent brand image and distributing images across trusted sources. He points out that Google tends not to confine the images displayed on the Brand SERP to those from the brand's website alone. By ensuring uniformity of the brand image across all mediums, including social media and other online platforms, businesses can enhance their probability of featuring in Image Boxes and Rich Sitelinks on Google.",2,17,2023-03-23 17:28:40

The Brand SERP includes the top result, rich sitelinks, people-also-ask boxes, Twitter boxes, and multiple bluelinks with images and related searches. However, there is a crucial element missing, which is a Knowledge Panel on the right-hand side of the SERP. According to Jason, it is a significant omission and Domestika could easily trigger a Knowledge Panel.

To obtain a Knowledge Panel, Domestika needs to create an entity home and direct all their social media sites and references to that entity home. This will help them build up their knowledge presence in Google's database, which can eventually lead to the creation of a Knowledge Panel. Jason suggests that adding a Knowledge Panel would be a valuable addition to their Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard, also recognized as the Brand SERP Guy, has evaluated the Brand SERP of Domestika and found it noteworthy.

However, there is a key missing component - a Knowledge Panel, which typically appears on the right side of the SERP. Jason considers this a significant shortcoming but believes that Domestika is well-positioned to trigger a Knowledge Panel. To achieve this, Jason advises Domestika to establish an entity home and link all their social media profiles and mentions back to this entity home.

He explains that Google is in the process of filling up Google My Business with information from Knowledge Graph ask information, and as a local business owner, it is important to start thinking about the Entity Home and educating Google. He notes that local business owners often fail to fill in the Google My Business properly, and human error or fake feedback can distort the truth. Moving Google My Business slowly into the Knowledge Graph will allow machines to ensure that the truth is in place and not distorted by human error.

Jason also talks about Schema Markup, stating that it does not guarantee a Knowledge Panel, but rather confirms what is already on the page. Google reads the page and understands what is there, but adding Schema markup can increase its confidence in the information. The aim of Schema Markup is to corroborate and confirm what is on the page, and to point Google to third-party corroborative sources that confirm the truth. When Google is confident in the information, it will trigger Knowledge Panels and spread the information to more people.

Jason compares Google to a child, noting that if a child is unsure about a piece of information, they will not shout it to others in fear of being wrong. Similarly, if Google is unsure about a piece of information, it will not trigger a Knowledge Panel. However, when Google is confident in the information, it will spread the information to more people.","Jason Barnard, also referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, elaborates on the significance of Google My Business Panels and the Knowledge Graph for local enterprises. He clarifies that Google is steadily populating Google My Business with data drawn from the Knowledge Graph. As such, local business proprietors ought to begin contemplating their Entity Home and how they can effectively educate Google. Barnard notes a common issue is the incomplete or inaccurate details that business owners provide in Google My Business, and the onslaught of counterfeit feedback, both of which can distort the reality. Gradually integrating Google My Business into the Knowledge Graph can permit machines to ascertain that the truth remains undistorted by human error. Additionally, Barnard mentions Schema Markup, clarifying that it doesn't necessarily guarantee a Knowledge Panel, but rather it verifies what already exists on the page. While Google comprehends the page's content, supplementing Schema Markup could enhance its confidence in the information. The objective of Schema Markup lies in affirming information on the webpage while steering Google towards third-party validating sources. When Google attains confidence in the info, it can trigger Knowledge Panels and circulate information more widely. Drawing an analogy with a child, Barnard postulates that if a child is doubtful about information, they would refrain from broadcasting it for fear of being mistaken. Analogously, if Google is uncertain about information, it won't trigger a Knowledge Panel. However, once assured of the validity of the information, it will disseminate that widely.",2,17,2023-03-23 08:25:07

Even without a website, these can appear on the first page of search results and serve as your brand's Google business card. If you have a website, ensure that it accurately reflects your brand message and includes meta titles and descriptions that tell Google what to display.

Jason emphasizes the importance of branding on the SERP and gives examples of big brands that have missed the mark. Amazon's Homepage used to feature ""cheap bicycles"" and ""Hi-Fi"" instead of their brand message, ""Smile More, Pay Less."" Coca-Cola's international Homepage lacked any brand messaging and instead featured copyright information. These examples demonstrate that many businesses fail to provide Google with the terms, sentences, and phrases that accurately represent their brand and convey their message to their audience.

To avoid such branding pitfalls, Jason suggests filling in the SEO title and description fields on your website and social media channels. This will help Google understand what you want to display to your audience and ensure that your brand message is accurately reflected on the SERP. Ultimately, by managing your Brand's SERP, you can gain insights into how the world perceives your brand and build a better perception that aligns with your own message.","Jason Barnard, also renowned as the core expert on Brand Search Engine Results Page (SERP) management, poses that the initial step in regulating your Brand SERP is to perfect your Google Business Profile and invigorate your social media channels.

If a website is already part of your digital arsenal, Jason insists that it should accurately echo your brand narrative and be equipped with precise meta tags?titles and descriptions?that coach Google on the information to spotlight. Jason points out the gravity of crafting a resonant branding impression on the SERP, even citing instances where reputed brands fell short. Amazon's home page, for instance, flagged irrelevant terms like ""cheap bicycles"" and ""Hi-Fi"" deviating from their true brand spirit of ""Smile More, Pay Less."" Similarly, Coca-Cola's global home page missed featuring any brand messaging and prioritized copyright information instead. This demonstrates the propensity of numerous businesses to miss the boat in feeding Google with defining terms and statements that mirror their brand authentically and convey an engaging brand narrative to their audience. To dodge such branding faux pas, Jason recommends optimizing the SEO title and description fields on your website's pages and social media profiles. Such tactical interventions can steer Google towards understanding your display preferences for your audience and assure your brand narrative is truthfully mirrored on the SERP. In the grand scheme of things, apt management of your Brand's SERP can gift insights into your brand's global perception and aid in cultivating a perception that aligns perfectly with your own brand vision.",2,17,2023-04-03 12:41:38

This question piqued his interest, and he was surprised to learn that Amazon had purchased a 16% stake in Deliveroo in May 2019. Jason finds it interesting that Google suggested this information to him on Deliveroo's Brand SERP, even though he was not actively seeking it.

Jason suggests that this is something to be aware of in the future. Google's algorithms are becoming more sophisticated and are increasingly able to predict the information that users may want to know. This means that companies need to be vigilant about their Brand SERPs and ensure that they are providing accurate and up-to-date information.

He suggests that if a brand doesn't have a Knowledge Panel, it means that Google hasn't understood the brand or is not confident in that understanding. Jason emphasizes the importance of entities in the future of SEO and highlights the need for Google to have confidence in its understanding of a brand for entity SEO to be effective. He also recommends updating and improving the Blue Links and content that a brand controls, improving social accounts and company profiles, and push up better content from below to leapfrog negative or irrelevant content on the Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard, commonly referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, stresses the significance of having a Knowledge Panel for a brand. It serves as a demonstration of Google's understanding and faith in the brand's identity, its functions, and its targeted audience. If a brand lacks a Knowledge Panel, it may imply that Google has not fully comprehended the brand's identity or is unsure of it. Jason brings attention to the growing importance of entities in the realm of SEO, and underlines the necessity for Google to possess a confident understanding of a brand for efficient entity SEO. He also advises brands to refine and update the Blue Links and content under their control, enhance social accounts and company profiles, and promote superior content to overshadow any negative or irrelevant content present on the Brand SERP.",2,17,2023-03-23 13:39:27

He explains that the idea of drowning bad content by creating lots of content to bury it is not effective, and instead, he suggests finding more relevant and valuable content to show Google that should be displayed higher in the search results.

To leapfrog, you need to prove to Google that the other content is more relevant, helpful, and valuable to your audience than the bad content currently being shown. This involves doing SEO for others by building links to their pages, updating titles, and improving the copywriting in their articles. The goal is to show Google that the other content is more deserving of being displayed on page one.

Jason's favorite trick is to trigger rich elements, such as video boxes, on your Brand SERP. This can potentially replace a blue link, reducing the number of blue links on page one and pushing the bad content further down the search results. If the bad content is still high on page one, the strategy is to find two or three great pieces of content on page two and do SEO on those to push them up, leapfrog above, and trigger rich elements to reduce the number of blue links on page one. While this process may be slow, it is effective and plays into a great digital marketing strategy.","Jason Barnard, dubbed ""The Brand SERP Guy,"" discusses how managing undesirable content in search results isn't about simply trying to ""drown"" it with a larger volume of new content. Instead, he introduces an alternative strategy known as ""leapfrogging."" This involves identifying and promoting content that's more relevant and valuable than the unfavorable content currently displayed prominently in search results. To successfully leapfrog, one must demonstrate to Google that the alternative content offers more relevance and value to the target audience. This could include performing SEO for other pages, optimizing their titles, enhancing their copywriting quality, and establishing more backlinks to their pages. The aim is to convince Google that other content deserves the front-page display. A top strategy for Barnard is encouraging rich elements like video boxes on your Brand SERP, which could potentially replace a simple blue link, thereby diminishing the blue link count on the first page and pushing the unfavorable content further down. If adversely affecting content remains high on page one, the tactic would be to identify and optimize two or three excellent pieces of content on page two. This will push them up to leapfrog the undesirable content and trigger rich elements that reduce the count of blue links on page one. Although this method might be time-consuming, it's an effective part of a broader digital marketing strategy.",2,17,2023-02-17 15:18:50

The people searching for something on Google are its users, not necessarily the audience of the brand. Google aims to bring the solution to the user's problem effectively and efficiently. If you understand this objective, you will be ahead of most people in your industry.

Previously, Google used to count words and links to determine the quality of a page, but that approach is now considered naive. Google now wants to train its machine to understand the world in the same way a human does. The machine learning algorithms aim to deliver the best possible result to the user by understanding their intent and context. Therefore, it's important to optimize your brand's message on Google so that the search engine can understand it and deliver it accurately to your audience.","Jason Barnard, emphasizes that Google's primary aim is to deliver the most suitable response to its users during a search. It's crucial to remember that Google's users are the individuals conducting the search and not necessarily the target audience of a particular brand. Google's goal is to efficiently and effectively address the user's query. Understanding this aim puts you at a significant advantage in your respective industry. In the past, Google relied on word and link counts to evaluate a page's quality, but this method is now considered outdated. Google's current approach involves training its machine learning algorithms to comprehend the world as a human does. The objective is to interpret user intent and context to provide the optimal response. Thus, it's essential to fine-tune your brand's message on Google to ensure the search engine can interpret and relay it accurately to your audience.",2,17,2023-03-28 17:09:17

On the right-hand side of the page, there is a Knowledge Panel that provides information about Alexa. Jason discusses the voice actor, Nina Rolle, and how Google is citing sources for this information. He explains that Google is increasingly crawling the web for information to populate its Knowledge Graph and suggests that in the future, companies may need to manage how Google sources information about their products and services.

Jason predicts that the trend of Google sourcing information from third-party news sources will continue and recommends that companies provide accurate and up-to-date information about their products and services to ensure that Google can find it easily. This will become increasingly important as Google relies more on the Knowledge Graph to provide answers to users' search queries. The Knowledge Graph is a database of information that Google uses to provide quick and accurate answers to users' questions, and it is constantly being updated with new information.","Jason Barnard, in his analysis, scrutinizes the Brand SERP for Alexa, Amazon's virtual assistant. The SERP includes standard results such as developer details, purchasing alternatives, videos, and Wikipedia entries. On the page's right-hand side, a Knowledge Panel presents information related to Alexa. Jason highlights the voice actor, Nina Rolle, and elaborates how Google relies on certain sources for this information. He asserts that Google constantly scours the internet for details to incorporate in its Knowledge Graph and anticipates that soon, businesses may need to monitor how Google gathers data concerning their offerings. Jason forecasts an ongoing trend of Google extracting data from third-party news outlets and advises corporations to disseminate precise, current information about their goods or services for easy accessibility by Google. As Google progressively depends on its Knowledge Graph to dispense answers to user searches, this will become increasingly critical.

According to Jason, Google's biggest problem is verifying the accuracy of information on the web due to its fragmented nature. However, he believes that brands can help Google understand their messaging by being clear and consistent about what they want to communicate. This will provide an anchor point for Google and help it determine whether the information it finds about the brand on the web confirms its messaging.

Jason also touched on the value of content that is not designed to draw traffic from Google. He gave an example of a client who deleted an entire section of their blog because it did not bring in any traffic from Google. However, he argued that this content still proves the client's expertise and authority in their field, and that Google sees and appreciates it even if it does not send traffic. He encouraged brands to consider whether content is helpful to their audience and can be leveraged through social media or other channels, rather than dismissing it as useless because it does not generate traffic from Google.","Jason Barnard, known as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", shed light on Google's process of compiling disjointed information about a brand on the web. He expressed that it is difficult for Google to verify the accuracy of the information on the web because it is very scattered. However, Barnard emphasized that it is possible to help Google decipher a brand's message through clear and consistent communication. This gives Google a reliable reference point that allows it to reconcile the brand's intended communication with any external data it discovers. Jason Barnard also emphasized the value of content that does not necessarily attract Google-driven traffic. He gave the example of a client who decided to scrap much of its blog content because it did not attract Google traffic. However, Barnard felt that such content still illustrated the client's authority and expertise in their particular field and that Google would recognize this regardless of the traffic it generated. In conclusion, Jason Barnard urged brands to consider the value of their content to their audience, regardless of Google traffic, and to use it across other channels such as social media, always prioritizing intrinsic value over mere traffic statistics.",2,17,2023-04-04 17:34:39

He recommends starting with things that you can directly control, such as your own website or sites within your group, and standardizing your brand message across all platforms. This consistency is appreciated by Google and helps to convince it that your message is the one that represents your brand.

Jason suggests moving on to semi-controlled platforms like social channels and review sites, but warns against trying to remove bad reviews, as this can backfire. Instead, he advises developing a strategy for dealing with them. Finally, he recommends going to all the platforms that talk about your brand and making sure the information is consistent and accurate, using this as corroboration to trigger a Knowledge Panel.

He notes that Sephora dominates the above-the-fold area of its Brand SERP, with its own site, ads, search boxes, and rich sitelinks. However, the most interesting feature is the Twitter and YouTube boxes that appear lower down the page. These boxes give brands real-time control over their Brand SERPs, allowing them to show their own content to their own audience.

Sephora has leveraged this feature to its advantage. Its Twitter feed appears in real-time on its Brand SERP, with tweets appearing within 17 seconds. Additionally, Sephora?s YouTube channel is linked to its Brand SERP, allowing the brand to show its own content to its audience. While the YouTube feed takes longer to appear on the Brand SERP (11 hours in this case), it still provides Sephora with a way to control its Brand SERP and show its message to its audience.

Jason Barnard recommends that brands use Twitter and YouTube boxes to gain real-time control over their Brand SERPs. By doing so, brands can show their own content to their audience when they search for their name. This provides brands with a way to control their message and prevent others from taking over their Brand SERP. Overall, Sephora?s use of Twitter and YouTube boxes serves as an example for other brands looking to gain control over their own Brand SERPs.","Jason Barnard, known as The Brand SERP Guy, carries out an analysis of Sephora's Brand SERP.

Sephora masterfully capitalizes on this feature as its Twitter feed is displayed in real-time on its Brand SERP, with tweets popping up within a strikingly quick span of 17 seconds. Additionally, links to Sephora?s YouTube channel are embedded in its Brand SERP, enabling the brand to present its unique content to its audience. Though the YouTube feed takes a longer time (around 11 hours in this specific case study) to appear on the Brand SERP, it still empowers Sephora with control over its Brand SERP, allowing them to convey their message to their audience. Jason Barnard advocates the use of Twitter and YouTube boxes for brands to acquire real-time control over their Brand SERPs. By leveraging this strategy, brands can display their distinct content to their audience during a name search, thereby controlling their narrative and warding off others from dominating their Brand SERP.

According to Jason, businesses need to focus on four key areas to improve their brand's SERP: understanding, credibility, user experience, and inherited credibility.

Jason stresses the importance of user experience, user behavior, and appearing for the right keywords. He suggests that businesses need to look at signals such as click-through rate, bounce rate, and dwell time to improve their user experience. He also highlights the importance of reviews, recommending that businesses search for their brand plus the word ""review"" to see what Google thinks about them. Jason recommends platforms such as Trustpilot, G2 Crowd, and Get Up to obtain positive reviews.

Another key area is links, mentions, and buzz. Jason suggests that businesses need to get positive buzz going around their brand and get thought leaders on board. He also introduces the concept of ""inherited credibility,"" where businesses can leverage their relationships with other entities, such as partnerships with big companies or awards won, to improve their credibility. Businesses can use Schema Markup to explicitly place this information in Google's algorithm.

In conclusion, Jason emphasizes the need for businesses to communicate and convince Google that they are the most credible solution or answer to its users for any given problem or question. He suggests that businesses focus on the four key areas mentioned above to improve their Brand's SERP.","Jason Barnard, known as The Brand SERP Guy, emphasizes the necessity for businesses to actively manage their Brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP) to enhance their digital footprint.

He underscores the value of user experience and behaviour in populating for the right keywords.

He suggests that the first step towards creating a good Brand SERP is to fill out the Google Business Profile and to maintain active social media channels, which are likely to appear on the first page of Google. For businesses without a website, he recommends creating a simple one-page website that describes who they are, what they do, and how they can serve their audience. For those with a website, he emphasizes the importance of ensuring that it accurately reflects their brand message.

Jason believes that Google is a reflection of the world's opinion of a business. When people search for a brand name on Google, they can get an insight into how the world perceives the brand. A positive perception is crucial to building a better brand message that corresponds to the company's values. He notes that many big businesses fail to accurately, positively, and convincingly reflect their brand message on their Brand SERP, and this can negatively affect their brand perception.

For businesses without a web presence, he proposes developing a basic one-page website outlining their identity, purpose, and audience service.

However, one area where Coral Windows could improve is by creating a Knowledge Panel to enhance their brand image and instill greater trust among their audience.

Jason explains that a Knowledge Panel would help Coral Windows look more impressive to their audience when they search for the brand name, and this is especially important because the first impression that users get of a company is often formed based on their appearance in the SERP. However, the absence of an About page on the company's website is hindering the creation of a Knowledge Panel. The About page currently serves as a sales page rather than a comprehensive overview of the company, which is preventing Google from understanding Coral Windows as an entity and from generating a Knowledge Panel.

Overall, Jason's analysis highlights the importance of creating a Knowledge Panel for companies that want to establish trust with their audience and enhance their brand image. Coral Windows has a strong Brand SERP, but the absence of a Knowledge Panel means that the company doesn't look like a big company that users can trust. By creating an About page that serves as a comprehensive overview of the company, Coral Windows could help Google generate a Knowledge Panel and further enhance their brand image.","Jason Barnard, known as the Brand SERP Guy, reviews the Brand SERP for Coral Windows, a double glazing company operating multiple outlets across Yorkshire. He commends the strong Brand SERP of the company, featuring a map pack, rich site links, People Also Ask, videos, images, and stellar reviews. However, the establishment of a Knowledge Panel for Coral Windows would serve the brand more favourably, augmenting their brand image and fostering increased trust among their audience. Jason clarifies that a Knowledge Panel would emphasize Coral Windows' credibility during brand name searches, underscoring the crucial first impression a company creates through its SERP display. The non-existence of an About page on their website hampers the formation of a Knowledge Panel. Currently functioning as a sales page rather than a detailed company profile, the About page's lack hinders Google's understanding of Coral Windows as an entity, thereby preventing the generation of a Knowledge Panel. Jason's analysis accentuates the critical need for a Knowledge Panel for companies eager to establish credibility with their audience and enhance their brand image. Despite boasting a strong Brand SERP, Coral Windows' lack of a Knowledge Panel may undermine their image as a large, trustworthy company. By crafting an About page with extensive company details, Coral Windows would enable Google to develop a Knowledge Panel that could significantly strengthen their brand image.",2,17,2023-02-20 12:21:30

While analyzing the rich sitelinks, Jason points out that the descriptions and titles are not great and that there isn't much written content behind the links. He suggests that this is because Supreme has not provided Google with enough information to generate effective sitelinks for their audience.

Jason then moves on to focus on the popular products section of the left rail. He notes that despite appearing to be an advertisement, the information is actually organic and gathered from around the web. This highlights the importance of educating Google about a company's products to ensure accurate representation on the Brand SERP. Supreme's left rail is filled with various products, emphasizing the importance of providing Google with information about the products a company manufactures and sells.

In conclusion, Jason emphasizes that providing Google with comprehensive information about a brand and its products is crucial to ensure accurate representation on the Brand SERP. He urges companies to focus on educating Google about their products to generate effective sitelinks and left rail displays. By doing so, companies can ensure that their audience is able to easily access information about their brand and products.","Jason Barnard, known as The Brand SERP Guy, underlines the significance of the left rail on the Brand SERP for Supreme, the American apparel company. Analyzing the rich sitelinks, Jason indicates that the titles and descriptions leave room for improvement, chiefly because there is sparse written content behind the links. He attributes this to Supreme's lack of sufficient information provision to Google to produce impactful sitelinks targeted at their audience. Jason continues his examination with a focus on the popular products section of the left rail. Despite seeming like a promotional segment, he clarifies that this is actually organic data accumulated from various web sources. This emphasizes the importance of familiarizing Google with a company's product portfolio to warrant an accurate depiction on the Brand SERP. He notes that Supreme's left rail showcases a variety of their products, reiterating the importance of furnishing Google with detailed information about the goods a company churns out and markets. Ultimately, Jason stresses that providing Google with thorough information about a brand and its products is paramount for proper Brand SERP representation. He advocates for companies to concentrate on informing Google about their product assortment to produce effective sitelinks and left rail presentations.

While organic traffic from Google is important, it should not be the sole focus of a brand's long-term strategy. Over-reliance on Google puts a business at risk, as any disruption could potentially harm its traffic and conversion rates.

Jason suggests that a solid, balanced digital strategy involves creating content for various platforms, including social media, newsletters, and returning customers. By doing so, a brand can establish multiple pillars to generate a steady flow of traffic and conversion rates. Focusing solely on Google is like relying on a table with only one leg or a cup of tea sitting on an imbalanced table; it will eventually fall over.

In conclusion, Jason advises businesses to shift their focus away from obsessing over Google and towards a multi-faceted approach that includes creating content for various platforms. Setting specific goals and KPIs for each piece of content created allows businesses to measure their success and adjust their strategies accordingly. By doing so, brands can establish a solid, balanced digital presence that can weather any disruptions that may arise.","Jason Barnard, known as The Brand SERP Guy, underscores the importance of defining clear objectives and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for each piece of content a brand creates. Although organic traffic catered by Google holds significance, it should not become the sole pivot point of a brand's enduring strategy. An overdependence on Google poses a potential risk, making a business susceptible to fluctuations which might adversely affect its traffic and conversion rates. Jason advocates for a well-rounded digital strategy that goes beyond Google, encompassing content creation for diverse platforms, such as social media, newsletters, and returning clientele, among others. This approach, akin to the stability provided by multiple pillars, ensures a consistent stream of traffic and conversion rates. Overemphasis on Google is compared to a lopsided table resting on a single leg, which is bound to topple over eventually. Jason's primary advice to businesses is to diversify their focus, deviating from an excessive Google obsession and steering towards a comprehensive strategy that includes creating content for an array of platforms. He asserts the importance of establishing precise goals and KPIs for each content piece, which aids businesses in measuring their progress and amending their strategies proactively. By doing so, brands can build a robust and balanced digital presence capable of withstanding potential disruptions.

By having separate websites for Kalicube the company, Kalicube Pro the SaaS platform, Kalicube Academy the courses, and Jason's personal website, they are all able to appear on each other's Brand SERPs, giving him control over what is being shown.

Jason also talks about how writing a book helped him to change Google's understanding of him from being a musician to an author, which is more in line with his current work in digital marketing. He had to overcome the challenge of convincing Google to let go of its understanding that he was a musician because that was how he was originally educated in trusted databases like Wikipedia and MusicBrainz. The book was the trigger for the change, and it helped to link his name as an author with the book itself.

Lastly, Jason talks about the importance of reviews and how he conducted an experiment to see if he could get reviews in the Knowledge Panel on Google. He received 15 reviews, but he was unsure of what the outcome would be. Reviews can help to increase visibility and credibility for a brand or individual, so it is important to consider ways to encourage customers to leave reviews on different platforms.","Jason Barnard, known by many as The Brand SERP Guy, discusses the benefits of creating distinct websites for each component of his company, Kalicube. By establishing individual websites for his company Kalicube, the Saas service Kalicube Pro, Kalicube Academy's courses, and his personal site, they can all feature in each other's Brand SERPs. This approach allows him greater control over the information displayed therein. A critical shift in Jason's image from musician to author, more in tune with his current profession in digital marketing, was brought about by publishing a book. Overcoming Google's initial categorization of him as a musician, a notion established in trustworthy databases such as Wikipedia and MusicBrainz, was quite challenging. However, the book was pivotal to this clarification and bridged the connection between him as a writer and the book itself. In addition, Jason elaborates on the significance of reviews. He ran an experiment aimed at attracting reviews on Google's Knowledge Panel. Despite receiving 15 evaluations, he remained uncertain about the potential effects.

He points out that the people who matter most to a business, such as clients, investors, partners, journalists, and potential hires, are all searching for the brand name at some point. As a result, the Brand SERP can affect a business's bottom line every single day. He suggests that if a business can dominate and control its Brand SERP, it can reduce client churn, increase conversion rates, and attract more potential hires.

Jason mentions that controlling the Brand SERP is not easy, especially if there are many people with similar names or if the brand name is ambiguous. He suggests that a business should rank number one in the search results and have positive Rich Sitelinks, Videos, Twitter Boxes, Images, and results that reflect well on the brand. He warns that negative or competitor results can appear in the search results and harm a business's digital marketing efforts. He believes that a business's digital ecosystem and content strategy can be evaluated by analyzing its Brand SERP. If Google is showing negative results, it means that the world's opinion of the business is not positive, and the business needs to figure out where it's getting it wrong and why Google is showing negative results.","Jason Barnard, known professionally as ""The Brand SERP Guy,"" stresses the importance of managing a brand's Search Engine Results Page (SERP). His key insight is that your brand SERP is invariably viewed by important stakeholder groups in your business - like clients, partners, potential investors, journalists, and prospective recruits. These searches directly impact your business's performance. By efficiently dominating and controlling your Brand SERP, you can minimize client turnover, improve conversion rates, and draw attention from potential employees.

However, ensuring control over Brand SERP can be a challenge, especially amidst competition or generic brand names. His advice is to secure the top ranking in search results and maintain positivity through Rich Sitelinks, Videos, Twitter Boxes, Images, and conductive results that bolster the brand's image.

Negative or competitor-related results jeopardizing your brand in search results can mar digital marketing attempts. Your Brand SERP, according to Jason, reflects your digital ecosystem and content planning.

Jason points out that the ""Latest From"" section on the SERP usually displays news articles, but in Nike's case, it leads to a category page for products with commercial intent.

When it comes to Video Boxes, Jason emphasized that Google loves videos and uses them to gather information.

Jason suggests that having a unique brand name is more advantageous than having a name that is common or easily confused with other companies. He notes that local trademark laws and registrations can help ensure uniqueness within industries.

He had conducted experiments by creating Wikipedia pages for his own brand, Boowa and Kwala, a TV series in 25 countries, and The Barking Dogs, the group he played in, which had played 600 concerts, including one with Bob Dylan. However, Wikipedia editors eventually deleted his pages, which hit his ego but also led him to understand that interfering with his own page hurt his brand more than it helped.

Despite the setback, Jason rebuilt his Knowledge Panel and Knowledge Graph presence, and found that the deletion of his Wikipedia page actually made his brand stronger. The Barking Dogs, and Boowa and Kwala entities became stronger because he had already prepared the groundwork for their online presence. On the other hand, his own Knowledge Graph presence and Knowledge Panel disappeared. He found this to be a fascinating result, as he had moved his online presence to his personal website, which he believes is more valuable than a Wikipedia page.

Jason's experience with creating his own Wikipedia pages taught him to avoid the platform for brand building purposes. He learned that interfering with his own page hurt his brand's online presence, and that moving his online presence to his personal website was more valuable than having a Wikipedia page. His experience also demonstrated the importance of preparing the groundwork for a brand's online presence, as this can lead to a stronger online presence even if a Wikipedia page is deleted.","Jason Barnard, often referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, advises against leveraging Wikipedia for creating a brand's digital footprint. In an experiment, he created Wikipedia articles for his own brand, the TV show 'Boowa and Kwala', aired in 25 countries, and 'The Barking Dogs', his band that has performed in 600 concerts, including one with Bob Dylan. Nonetheless, Wikipedia administrators erased his entries eventually, hitting his pride and revealing to him that meddling with his own page proved to be more detrimental than beneficial for his brand. Regardless of this hitch, he restored his Knowledge Panel and Knowledge Graph manifestations and noticed that his brand fortification grew stronger post-Wikipedia page deletion. He had precooked the basis of the online existence of both 'The Barking Dogs' and 'Boowa and Kwala' entities, strengthening their online presence. Conversely, his personal Knowledge Graph presence and Knowledge Panel disappeared. He discovered this outcome intriguing, as he had transitioned his online presence to his personal website, which he views as more valuable than a Wikipedia page. Through creating his Wikipedia pages, Jason fathomed the importance of avoiding this platform for brand-building purposes. He also comprehended that tampering with his own page detrimentally affected his brand's digital presence, and transferring his online existence to his personal website reaped more benefits than having a Wikipedia entry. His experience further accentuated the necessity of laying the groundwork for a brand's digital presence ahead of time, as this could lead to a healthier online presence even if a Wikipedia article is deleted.",2,17,2023-02-27 09:20:38

A Brand SERP displays the search results for a specific brand, including information such as the company's website, social media profiles, and reviews. Jason explains that a weak content marketing strategy will result in a Brand SERP filled with generic Blue Links, whereas a strong video or social media strategy will result in video or social media profiles being displayed.

Jason emphasizes that having a great communication strategy about the brand entity will result in the Knowledge Panel being displayed in the Brand SERP. The Knowledge Panel provides detailed information about the brand, such as its history and notable achievements. He concludes that a Brand SERP can instantly reveal whether a company's content strategy is effective and how it can be improved, such as by investing in video marketing or communicating the value of content to Google.","Jason Barnard, often referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, highlights the value of a robust content strategy in achieving an optimal Brand SERP, which showcases search results unique to a brand comprising of particulars like the firm's website, social media accounts, and customer reviews. Jason points out that a lackluster content marketing plan will lead to a Brand SERP crammed with commonplace Blue Links, while an effective video or social media campaign will bring forth video content or social media profiles. He stresses that having a compelling brand entity narrative can result in the emergence of a Knowledge Panel in the Brand SERP; this panel offers extensive information about the brand, including its background and significant milestones. In conclusion, Jason emphasizes that a Brand SERP can swiftly disclose the effectiveness of a company's content strategy and guide improvement initiatives, such as investing in video promotion or demonstrating the importance of subject matter to Google.",2,17,2023-04-04 13:07:00

He discusses the concept of ""doing a Disney,"" which refers to owning and controlling every single BlueLink on the left-hand side of the Brand SERP with a domain that one owns. Disney was the first company to achieve this feat, and since then, other companies have followed suit, including Kalicube, which was able to achieve it with Kalicube Tuesdays.

Jason notes that ASUS has two sets of results from the exact same site at the top of their Brand SERP, including their own homepage and Rich Sitelinks. This is unusual because Google sees the support section as a distinct area of the site, similar to how it perceives a subdomain. While ASUS doesn't quite achieve ""doing a Disney"" because Wikipedia is preventing them from doing so at the bottom of the page, they could potentially achieve this by controlling another site on page two and pushing it up to page one.

Despite the fact that ASUS may not be interested in ""doing a Disney,"" Jason finds the concept intellectually interesting to observe. He notes that achieving this feat is a useful tactic for companies to control their brand and avoid negative content on the left-hand side of the Brand SERP. By owning and controlling all BlueLinks, a company can dictate the narrative and ensure that their messaging is consistent and aligned with their brand values.","Jason Barnard, often referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, takes a closer look at the Brand SERP for ASUS, a company known for its computer hardware products. He analyses the idea of ""doing a Disney"", implying the complete ownership and control of all the BlueLinks appearing on the left side of a Brand SERP, restricted to domains that are entirely owned by the brand. Disney holds the credit for being the first to successfully implement this strategy, inspiring other companies, including Kalicube, which utilized this approach for Kalicube Tuesdays. It is noteworthy that ASUS's Brand SERP displays two sets of results from the same site, which includes their homepage and Rich Sitelinks, at the top. Google's categorization of the support section as a significant part of the site, akin to a subdomain, is the reason behind this anomaly. ASUS has not fully accomplished ""doing a Disney"", with Wikipedia posing a hindrance at the page's bottom. However, they could possibly reach this goal by managing another site from page two and elevating it to page one. Despite the uncertainty regarding ASUS's inclination to ""do a Disney"", Jason expresses a keen intellectual interest in the strategy's practicality. He acknowledges the utility of dominating the Brand SERP left-hand side by controlling all BlueLinks for a company trying to manage their brand and keep misinterpretations or negative content at bay. This approach enables the brand to maintain control over its narrative, ensuring consistent messaging that resonates accurately with their brand's values.",2,17,2023-02-20 10:35:18

He notes that many SEOs approach this task as a typical SEO task, but it requires a slightly different approach and prioritization. The process is simple but slow, with updates taking up to three months to show any effect. Jason believes that sites that Google trusts more will have their data processed faster, whereas those it doesn't trust will be left in the ""Google dance"" of waiting for updates.

Jason also discusses the concept of data lakes and data rivers in Google's indexing process. Data rivers are like gold panning, where the algorithm pulls out ""golden nuggets"" of information it trusts from sites it trusts, while data lakes store all the data that doesn't make the cut. The Knowledge Panel is a data lake that sorts through information to determine trust and authority. He notes that the delays in updating the Knowledge Panel can take between one to three months and emphasizes that patience is key.

Jason recommends using Kalicube.Pro to monitor Knowledge Graph updates to know when updates occur. He emphasizes that Google is constantly improving and updating its system, which will ultimately benefit users. He encourages site owners to focus on building trust and authority with Google to increase the likelihood of being featured in the Knowledge Panel.","Jason Barnard, otherwise recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, elucidated the obstacles tied to acquiring and keeping a Google Knowledge Panel in search results. He observes that many SEO professionals tackle this challenge as standard SEO work, but it necessitates a somewhat distinct method and ranking. The process is clear yet requires patience, with changes taking up to a quarterly period to manifest any impact. Jason suggests that websites with higher confidence from Google will see their data processed swifter, while others lacking trust will face a waiting game referred to as the ""Google dance"" when awaiting updates. Further, Barnard elaborated on the notion of data lakes and data rivers within Google's indexing mechanism. Data rivers can be likened to gold prospecting, where the algorithm extracts ""golden nuggets"" ? the data it deems trustworthy ? from the sites it trusts, and data lakes store all the data that doesn't make the cut. The Knowledge Panel is akin to a data lake, sorting through information to establish trust and authority. He highlights that updating the Knowledge Panel can take from one to three months, underlining the necessity of patience. Jason recommends utilizing Kalicube.Pro to monitor updates to the Knowledge Graph and stay informed on when modifications happen. He accentuates that Google consistently strives to enhance its system, an effort that will ultimately better the user experience.

He describes an instance where a brand created a page that explained the concept of login pages instead of providing an actual login page. Google subsequently displayed this page in the search results instead of the correct login page.

Jason explains that Google wants to be helpful and that the issue arises because the page is not explicit enough in its content to convey its purpose to Google. He suggests that brands should take a step back and try to understand why Google may be making this mistake. By doing so, they can ensure that their pages are clear and that their purpose is explicit. Jason emphasizes that simple common sense can often help solve these issues and that brands should optimize their pages to help Google understand their purpose correctly.","Jason Barnard, popularly known as The Brand SERP Guy, addresses a frequent problem where Google incorrectly interprets the function of a website's login page.

Jason further explains that he has successfully found his niche in Brand SERPs, which is what people see when they Google a brand or personal name. He coined the term himself, and as a result, he has successfully educated Google about the concept. He has noticed that Google is becoming increasingly smart about suggesting helpful and interesting solutions to searchers based on their search queries.

He had previously experimented with using a Wikipedia page to see how it affected the Knowledge Graph and Panel, but the page was deleted by Wikipedia when they became annoyed with his experimentation. Jason found that if his Wikipedia page said he was an SEO consultant, the Knowledge Graph would also say he was an SEO consultant. However, he believes that Google is letting go of the training wheels that are Wikipedia and that we can now build our presence in the Knowledge Graph and get a Knowledge Panel without relying on Wikipedia.

Jason cites Rand Fishkin, who had his own Wikipedia page deleted because he did not want someone else controlling what was being said about him.

Step two is to consider what the brand would like to see, such as videos or Twitter posts, and then either develop a strategy to achieve it or improve the existing strategy.

When it comes to companies with the same name in the same geographic region, Jason suggests that the dominant entity is the one that will be prioritized by Google. He emphasizes the importance of having a strong digital PR strategy to communicate dominance to Google and to educate it better about the brand than its namesake.

Jason realized that he needed to separate his personal life from his professional life as The Brand SERP Guy.

In both cases, the external accountability helped him to stay motivated and get the work done on time.

Jason also discussed how setting a regular schedule has helped him with his podcast, Kalicube Tuesdays.

Jason emphasizes that Brand SERPs are not about all searches that include a brand name, but rather, they refer to the exact match brand name SERP. He argues that until a brand has control of their Brand SERP, all other efforts will be more difficult.

Jason explains that the Brand SERP may seem boring at first, but it is actually a highly focused and controlled environment where brands have more control than they initially imagine. By analyzing the content displayed on the Brand SERP, brands can gain insights into their digital ecosystem, content strategy, and what Google thinks is relevant and valuable to their audience. According to Jason, understanding the Brand SERP is insightful because it reveals what Google is trying to do with all other SERPs. He is passionate about the concept and considers it the best rabbit hole in the business, urging others to pay attention to it.","Jason Barnard, popularly referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, acknowledges some confusion surrounding his idea of Brand SERPs. Contrary to what some people might think, Brand SERPs are not about any search including a brand's name, but rather pertain strictly to the exact match of the brand's name in a Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Jason asserts that controlling their Brand SERP is a vital, foundational step for any brand ? from there, all other efforts become facilitated.

He notes that Google is trying to understand who you are and what you do in order to better match you to its users when they search for anything related to your topic. With Google Podcasts, the information is injected directly into Google's brain, making podcasts a powerful tool for SEO strategy. In October 2021, Google updated its algorithms and triggered Knowledge Panels for many podcasts, with around 50% of them receiving one.

Jason explains that people often ask him how to fill up their Podcast Knowledge Panel with extra information. He provides an example of a podcast that is starting to be populated with additional information, explaining that the information comes from Google crawling the web and deciding that these are facts. Kalicube Pro tracks this information and distinguishes between human-curated and machine-curated facts. WebFacts 2nd Generation has recently been introduced, where the machine makes its mind up about the facts, and it looks like this is going to be increasingly common. The attributes in the Knowledge Panel for How I Built This come from WebFacts Generations 1 and 2, and Jason notes that this is the future of knowledge on the web in Google.

In conclusion, podcasts are an effective tool for SEO and widening one's audience, and the Knowledge Panel is a valuable asset to have. Google's thirst for information means that podcasts are an excellent way to convey information about who you are, what you do, and who your audience might be. As WebFacts 2nd Generation gains traction, it will become increasingly important to track and understand how Google is obtaining information for Knowledge Panels.","Jason Barnard, professionally known as The Brand SERP Guy, underscores the significance of Google's Knowledge Panel for podcasts in SEO considerations. He emphasizes Google's relentless quest to comprehend your identity and your activities to efficiently match you with the appropriate audience upon their search requests related to your subject matter.

In the recent update of October 2021, Google activated Knowledge Panels for a multitude of podcasts, nearly half were beneficiaries of this feature. Barnard often fields questions about how to add supplemental information to their Podcast Knowledge Panel. He gives an illustrative example of a podcast reaping the benefits of additional data, indicating that this information is sourced from Google's wide-ranging internet crawling activities. These obtained ""facts"" are tracked by Kalicube Pro, distinguishing between data curated by humans and those curated by machines. The company has just launched the second iteration of their WebFacts feature, exhibiting the machine's independent fact-deciding process?a trend Barnard predicts will rise in popularity. He identifies the attributes in the Knowledge Panel for the How I Built This podcast as a mix of the first and second generation WebFacts, foretelling this kind of data compilation method as the future of web knowledge within Google.

This is because the majority of editors on these platforms come from the Western world, are white and male. Jason argues that this bias affects Google's Knowledge Graph, which is Google's understanding of the world. He gives the example of Dixon Jones, who mentioned that a pier in Ethiopia could be important to Ethiopian history, but Wikipedians may not recognize its significance. Therefore, Jason suggests that the bias in these platforms should be addressed so that the information presented is more diverse and inclusive.","Jason Barnard, professionally referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, believes Wikipedia and Wikidata show a distinct bias favoring the Western world, particularly encapsulating the white American demographic.

According to Jason, Bing and Google have the same data set, aim, and user base. Both search engines aim to recommend the best solution to a problem or the best answer to a question. He discovered that Bing has a whole page algorithm that sits on top of the basic Blue Link algorithm, which overrides the Rich Elements if user data shows that it does not bring satisfaction quickly and efficiently.

Jason noted that the whole aim of search engines is to get the user to satisfaction as quickly and efficiently as possible. If the answer can be provided on the SERP, search engines will show it. Google and Bing's aim is to give the user the answers on the SERP, but if they cannot, they will send them through to the site. From a content creator's perspective, they need to ensure that their content can satisfy the user, and they need to brand it to take the place on the SERP. He also mentioned that creators should optimize their videos or tweets to get brand visibility through different platforms, including YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn.

Overall, the interviews with Bing employees shed light on the fact that search engines aim to satisfy the user's search intent as quickly and efficiently as possible. Content creators should keep this in mind when creating content and aim to provide the answer on the SERP, and if not, ensure that their content can satisfy the user.","Jason Barnard, recognized as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", shares his knowledge gleaned from discussions with Bing's personnel.

Jason uncovers that Bing employs a special ""whole page algorithm"" that enhances the fundamental Blue Link algorithm, and overrides the Rich Elements when user data indicates they aren't achieving user satisfaction swiftly and efficiently. He reinforces that the primary objective of search engines is to expedite user satisfaction. When it's feasible to provide responses on the Search Engine Result Page (SERP), search engines will opt to do so. However, in the event they can't, they'll direct users to the necessary site. Content creators, as per Jason, need to ensure their content is capable of satisfying the user, is well-branded, and secures its spot on the SERP.

He compares the competition perceived by Google in the UK and New York. In the UK, the competition in the right rail includes Lipton, Tetley, Dilmah, and Whittard of Chelsea, whereas in New York, the competition on the left-hand side includes Tetley, Harney and Sons, Tazo, and Celestial Seasoning. Google's perception of competition or equivalent entities varies significantly across different regions, and Twinings has different sets of entity equivalents or competitors in each of these two countries.

Google's ability to determine the same entity type, same geo-region, and same industry in different regions is crucial in identifying competition for a brand. Jason notes that the perceived competition for Twinings would differ significantly in various countries, such as Australia, Ireland, or India. It is evident that Google is constantly updating its algorithms to provide the best possible results based on the user's location and search queries. By understanding the competition perceived by Google in different regions, brands can optimize their Brand SERPs to improve their online visibility and reputation management.","Jason Barnard, recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, breaks down the Brand SERP for Twinings, a renowned English tea company.

Google's proficiency in discerning similar entity types, geographies, and industries across differing regions is integral to pinpointing a brand's competition. Jason observes that the perceived rivals for Twinings would significantly differ in other nations, including Australia, Ireland, or India.

He focuses on the latter, which is the search results page for a person's exact name. He believes that Google's perception of a person is a reflection of the world's perception, and this perception is crucial. When a person's name is shared with someone else who is highly visible online, it can be difficult to rank high on Search Engine Results Pages. For example, Ben Shapiro, an American commentator, dominates the search results page for the name Ben Shapiro, and his Knowledge Panel appears at the top. However, if Benjamin Shapiro were to use the name Benjamin instead, his website and Twitter account would appear in the search results, but Shapiro would still be outranked by Ben Shapiro.

Jason points out that Shapiro's official site in his Knowledge Panel is Twitter, which means that Twitter has control over his entity. This is a significant mistake because Google thinks that Shapiro's entity lives on Twitter. In contrast, Benjamin Shapiro's entity is benshap.com, which is much better. By focusing on exact match brand search, individuals can control how they appear on Search Engine Results Pages, which can affect their online reputation and conversion rate.","Jason Barnard, recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, differentiates branded searches from exact match brand queries, with his emphasis being on the latter. This entails search results obtained when a user searches for a person's precise name. He holds the view that how Google perceives an individual mirrors the world's perception, making it crucial. The ranking on Search Engine Results Pages can often be challenging when the individual's name is similar to another who has prominent online visibility. An instance is Ben Shapiro, an American commentator whose name heavily dominates the search results page, with his Knowledge Panel surfacing at the top. If Benjamin Shapiro opts to use Benjamin instead, his website and Twitter account might show up in the search results, but would remain underneath Ben Shapiro. Jason emphasizes that Shapiro?s indicating Twitter as the official site in his Knowledge Panel implies that Twitter is managing his entity. This is seen as a significant misstep since according to Google, Shapiro's entity resides on Twitter. On the contrary, Benjamin Shapiro's entity is associated with benshap.com, which is preferable. By concentrating on exact match brand queries, individuals can exert influence on how they present themselves on Search Engine Results Pages, which can impact their online reputation as well as their conversion rate.",2,17,2023-03-30 13:41:23

He referenced a statistic he had heard from Neil Schaffer, which states that 95% of people consume content while only 5% create it. This means that as a creator, there are many more people out there who are potentially interested in what you have to offer. Even if it's just a small number of people who appreciate your content, that's still a valuable audience.

Jason also talked about the potential value of sharing your skills and knowledge with others. He noted that you never know how valuable your content or skill set might be to someone else until you start sharing it. Whether you're looking to build a business or just gain a following among a small group of people, Jason encourages everyone to share what they have to offer. Ultimately, there is a vast potential audience out there, and even a small group of dedicated followers can make a big difference.","Jason Barnard, recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, elaborated on the premise that the internet offers a ripe platform for creators, given its vast user base predominantly comprised of consumers. Citing a statistic from Neil Schaffer, he illustrated that while only 5% the internet's populace are content creators, the remaining 95% are consumers, reinforcing that there is a vast potential audience for creators. Regardless of the niche appeal of your content, you can still cultivate a valued following. Furthermore, Jason emphasised the unforeseen value in sharing skills and knowledge; the significance of your content or skillsets may surprise others once they're out in the open. Whether you're motivated by entrepreneurial pursuits or a simple desire to foster a dedicated following, Jason urges all creators to showcase their offerings.

578,Transcript,https://thebrandserpguy.com/daily-brand-serp/musicgroup/oasis/,Top Band Oasis Suffers from the Curse of Ambiguity on their Brand SERP,"Jason Barnard, also known as the Brand SERP Guy, analyzes the Brand SERP for Oasis, a popular rock group from the 90s. Despite being a big name in the music industry, their Brand SERP is not entirely dominated by their own content. The left-hand side of the results page shows the top result with their own website, followed by the Wikipedia result. However, other results are not relevant to the band, such as the definition of Oasis on Wikipedia and some Google Maps results. Even the Oasis open, which is unclear what it is, appears in the results.

According to Jason, Oasis' ambiguous name is the reason why they cannot fully dominate their Brand SERP. Sharing a name with other entities, such as companies or locations, creates competition for visibility in search results. This demonstrates the importance of choosing a unique and distinctive name for a brand or product, especially in a crowded industry where standing out is crucial.

Jason concludes that having an ambiguous name will make it difficult for businesses or bands to completely control their Brand SERP. Therefore, choosing a clear and unique name is essential for having a strong online presence and dominating search results.","Jason Barnard, recognized as the Brand SERP Guy, examines the Brand SERP for the renowned 90s rock band, Oasis. Their Brand SERP unexpectedly lacks complete content coverage, despite their sizeable influence in the music scene. The left-hand portion of the search results exhibits their official website as the top outcome, followed by a Wikipedia entry. However, several other search results are unrelated to the band, including a definition of Oasis via Wikipedia and various Google Maps findings. It also includes the puzzling 'Oasis open,' the context of which is unclear. According to Jason, the issue of not being able to entirely dominate their Brand SERP relates to Oasis's non-distinct name. Entities sharing the same name, whether they are businesses or geographical locations, lead to visibility competition within search results. This emphasizes the importance of a one-of-a-kind and distinctive brand or product identity, particularly in populated sectors where differentiation is key. Jason summarises that the presence of ambiguity in a name will challenge bands or businesses' control over their Brand SERP. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to opt for a distinguishable name to uphold a robust digital footprint and control search results.",2,17,2023-03-18 11:53:42

One of the biggest challenges is dealing with ambiguity, particularly for companies with generic or misleading names. For example, a company called ""Best Car Sales"" would have to compete with sites that offer advice on the best car sales, making it difficult to establish a clear and accurate online identity. In contrast, companies with unique brand names are easier to identify and explain to Google, which can improve their chances of appearing in a Knowledge Panel.

Jason explains that Schema Markup can help build confidence with Google, but it cannot replace the importance of a clear and unique brand identity. Schema Markup can only confirm what is already on the page and point to corroborative sources, helping to increase Google's confidence in the information. However, if the information is unclear or ambiguous, it will not be useful to Google or its users. Therefore, companies should prioritize building a strong brand identity with a unique and easily recognizable name, as this will have a greater impact on their Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel.

Overall, managing a Brand SERP requires careful attention to detail and a focus on building a strong and unique brand identity. Companies with generic or misleading names may struggle to establish themselves online, while those with clear and unique brand identities are more likely to appear in a Knowledge Panel and gain visibility on the internet.","Jason Barnard, recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, explores the complexities surrounding the management of a Brand SERP - the search results displayed when someone hunts for a specific brand name. The gravest challenge surfaces when dealing with ambiguity, particularly when the companies have generic or misleading names. For instance, a firm named ""Best Car Sales"" would face competition with sites offering advice on optimum car sales, thereby marring their ability to create a transparent and accurate digital identity. Conversely, corporations with unique brand names are easier to differentiate and define to Google, boosting their chances of a spot in a Knowledge Panel. Jason illustrates that while Schema Markup can boost Google's confidence, it cannot take the place of a clear and distinct brand identity. Schema Markup can merely affirm the content already on the page and reference supporting sources, thereby enhancing Google's trust in the information. However, if the information is ambiguous or unclear, it holds no value for Google or its users. Consequently, firms should concentrate on building an influential brand identity with a distinctive, easily identifiable name, as it will greatly impact their Brand SERP and appearance on a Knowledge Panel. Overall, managing a Brand SERP necessitates meticulous attention to detail and a focus on building a solid and unique brand identity. Companies with generic or misleading names may find it difficult to establish their online presence while those with identifiable and distinct brand identities are likely to appear on a Knowledge Panel and enhance their internet visibility.",2,17,2023-03-23 08:38:24

He points out the new Vertical Rich Sitelinks on the left-hand side of the SERP, which he thinks are pretty cool. As he scrolls down, he notices that Aram Store has an impressive Google Business Profile on the right-hand side, which includes a lot of reviews, product information, Q&A, and social profiles. However, he points out that there are no Rich Elements on the left-hand side and suggests that Aram Store could potentially add Image Boxes or Video Boxes to match up with the right-hand side.

Jason couldn't find a YouTube channel for Aram Store, but he notes that the company is active on Facebook and Instagram. He suggests that Aram Store could also use Twitter to improve their Brand SERP even further. He notices that Twitter is hovering on the brink of coming onto the first page of the SERP, and if Aram Store can push it up to the top of the first page and get people engaging, they could potentially have Twitter Boxes on the left-hand side.

Overall, Jason thinks that Aram Store is doing a great job with their Google Business Profile, but there is room for improvement on the left-hand side of the SERP. By adding more rich information such as Images, Videos, and Twitter Boxes, they could create a more balanced and impressive Brand SERP.","Jason Barnard, recognized as the Brand SERP Guy, undertakes a comprehensive assessment of the Brand SERP of Aram Store, a London-based furniture outlet. He highlights the presence of the fresh Vertical Rich Sitelinks on the left-hand segment of the SERP, an element he finds commendable. Upon moving down the page, Jason commends the striking Google Business Profile that Aram Store possesses on the right side. This includes vast reviews, product specifics, Q&A, and social profiles. But he also points out the absence of Rich Elements on the left-hand side, suggesting that Image Boxes or Video Boxes could be added for parity with the right-hand side. Despite Jason's unsuccessful search for a YouTube channel linked to Aram Store, he applauded their active virtual presence on Facebook and Instagram. He proposes that embracing Twitter could further amplify their Brand SERP. Observing that Twitter is on the cusp of breaching the top page of the SERP, he believes engaging and promoting Twitter interaction could elevate Twitter Boxes on the left-hand side.

He focuses on the Brand SERP for the Search Engine Journal Show, a podcast for SEO and marketing professionals. Jason notes that Google recently triggered a large number of Knowledge Panels for podcasts that were not previously visible on the search engine, including for his own podcast.

Jason explains that Google is constantly seeking information to better understand a website's content and audience. By providing informative podcasts, websites can supply Google with valuable data about their brand, niche, and target audience. Google Podcasts is particularly powerful in this regard, as the information is fed directly into the search engine's algorithm.

Therefore, Jason advises businesses to consider incorporating podcasts into their marketing strategies. Not only can podcasts improve SEO, but they can also broaden the audience and potentially lead to increased sales conversions.","Jason Barnard, recognized by his professional alias ""The Brand SERP Guy"", elucidates the significant role that podcasts can play in enhancing SEO for a website. He places emphasis on the Brand SERP related to the Search Engine Journal Show, a popular podcast geared toward SEO and marketing experts. Barnard observes that Google has recently instigated a considerable number of Knowledge Panels for podcasts, including his, which previously maintained a low profile in the search engine realm. He asserts that Google continuously seeks more accurate comprehensions of a website's content and its respective audience. Accordingly, websites that furnish rich, enlightening podcasts present Google with invaluable data regarding their brand, their specialist segment, and their intended audience. Incredibly effective in this respect is Google Podcasts, which feeds information directly into the search engine's algorithm. Consequently, Barnard strongly encourages businesses to think about embedding podcasts into their marketing portfolios. Besides the benefits podcasts offer to SEO, they also have the ability to diversify the audience and might potentially drive an increase in sale conversions.",2,17,2023-03-26 18:37:43

He highlights the significance of the company's approach to internal linking, known as ""Doing a Disney"", which involves linking every blue link in the search results to their own site. This technique is especially impressive in Screaming Frog's case, as it is all on a single domain, unlike Disney's multiple sites. In the UK, Screaming Frog dominates the Brand SERP, occupying the top half with their internal links.

Jason's analysis of the Screaming Frog's Brand SERP shows how crucial it is for companies to take control of their search results by optimizing their website's internal linking structure. ""Doing a Disney"" technique ensures that a company's website dominates the search results by linking all blue links back to the company's site, creating a clear and consistent message to potential customers. This strategy becomes even more effective when used on a single domain, as it allows the company to take up more space on the search results page. Screaming Frog's approach to internal linking has allowed them to achieve an impressive presence on the Brand SERP, highlighting the importance of an effective search engine optimization strategy for businesses.","Jason Barnard, referred to as the Brand SERP Guy, analyses the Brand SERP of Screaming Frog, a London-based software and marketing firm. He emphasizes the importance of the company's ""Doing a Disney"" approach to internal linking, which ingeniously causes every blue link in search results to direct back to their website. What's particularly notable in the case of Screaming Frog is that this technique has been effectively implemented on a single domain, as opposed to multiple domains in Disney's context. In the UK, Screaming Frog has efficiently commandeered the upper section of the Brand SERP with their internal links. Jason's experimental examination of the Screaming Frog Brand SERP elucidates the criticality for corporates to regulate their search results by optimizing their internal linking architecture. Practicing the ""Doing a Disney"" technique ensures a company's dominance on the search results by reverting all blue links back to the business's website, consequently delivering a coherent and consistent message to prospective clients. When employed on a singular domain, this strategy amplifies its effectiveness by monopolizing more real estate on the search results page. The internal linking strategy adopted by Screaming Frog has enabled them to carve out a pronounced presence on the Brand SERP, exemplifying the significance of a sound search engine optimization strategy for enterprises.",2,17,2023-02-28 01:46:33

He notes that at the top of the SERP, there are two commercial results and some ads for pre-ordering the phone, followed by informational content such as top stories, reviews, FAQs, and videos. This is because the product is not yet available.

Jason goes on to highlight how the SERP for a product like the iPhone 13 can evolve over time, from the announcement to its release date. He uses the iPhone 12 as an example, where the SERP was initially similar to the iPhone 13, with ads at the top and right-hand side of the page, shops in the middle, and related products at the bottom. However, as the release date approached, the SERP became dominated by ads, with more emphasis on buying the product from Apple. He emphasizes that Google will adapt a Brand SERP based on the current circumstances, and a Brand SERP can change and evolve over time.","Jason Barnard, referred to as The Brand SERP Guy, delves into the analysis of the brand new iPhone 13, announced on September 19, 2021.

This indicates that the product is yet to be available. Jason further elaborates on the transformation of a product's SERP over time, from its initial announcement to the release date. The perfect example is the iPhone 12, whose SERP initially mirrored that of the iPhone 13 with ads positioned at the top and the right-hand side of the page, stores at the center, and associated products at the bottom. However, as the release date neared, the SERP shifted towards containing more advertisements and promoting direct purchases from Apple.

By actively controlling the first two to three pages of search results, it becomes difficult for negative content to rank. This is because the negative content has to prove itself to be valuable to the audience in Google's eyes, which is a challenging task if it is buried on page five or six. Thus, by actively managing your Brand SERP, you are protecting yourself against the negative content that could harm your brand.

Once negative content does arise, traditional Online Reputation Management (ORM) techniques suggest drowning it out by creating new content. However, Jason argues that this approach is ineffective because it creates new content that has no value in Google's eyes. Instead, he recommends leapfrogging - finding existing content that is valuable and helpful to your audience, and helping Google understand that it should rank higher than the negative content. By doing so, you can control the message and ensure that the negative content has trouble getting anywhere near it.

Overall, actively managing and protecting your Brand SERP can not only improve your digital marketing strategy and help your audience, but also protect you against negative content. By controlling the message, you can ensure that your brand is presented in the best possible light and that negative content has difficulty ranking.","Jason Barnard, renowned as The Brand SERP Guy, highlights the importance of securing your Brand SERP diligently. By actively controlling the initial two to three search results pages, it becomes a challenge for negative content to make its way up the ranks. This is attributed to the fact that such content needs to establish its significance to the audience from Google's perspective, which is a tough feat if situated on the fifth or sixth page. Consequently, active management of your Brand SERP provides a safeguard against potentially damaging negative content. On encountering negative content, traditional Online Reputation Management (ORM) methods propose flooding it with newly generated content. But, Jason believes this strategy is substandard as it renders new content worthless from Google's viewpoint. He suggests a leapfrogging tactic instead - identifying pre-existing content that holds value and is beneficial to your audience, and aiding Google in recognizing its higher ranking over the negative content. In this way, you can exert control over the message ensuring the negative content finds it hard to compete. In summary, active management and safeguarding of your Brand SERP can not only enhance your digital marketing efforts and benefit your audience but also provide a shield against harmful content. By controlling the narrative, you can present your brand positively and make it difficult for any negative content to secure a high rank.",2,17,2023-03-23 10:57:09

He developed the Kalicube Pro platform to provide a more complete solution for working with clients who are knowledgeable about their industry. The platform crawls and collects references for users to organise and write descriptions of their entities. The machine learning algorithm analyses the text to see if it is understood by Google's natural language processing. The platform also identifies equivalent entity types within the same industry and region to help focus on the relevant sources.

Kalicube has a database of 70,000 brands and can do bespoke work to identify the top news sources for a specific entity. By uploading a list of entity equivalents, industry, geo, and entity type, Kalicube can pull out fresh data within half an hour. For example, Kalicube identified the top 10 news sources for an American footballer and the client was able to secure three articles in a week by contacting only five sources. Jason's aim is to offer Kalicube as a self-service platform so that he can focus on collecting data to provide valuable information for the community to use more efficiently and effectively.

Jason emphasises the importance of writing a great description that the machine can understand as it is the foundation of everything that follows. Kalicube's platform helps users to focus on the right sources for their entity type within their industry and region. By providing a self-service platform, Jason hopes to gather more data to enhance the understanding of the process for managing Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels.","Jason Barnard, the brain behind Kalicube, has dedicated his career to aiding businesses and individuals in improving their Brand SERP and Knowledge Panels. To offer a comprehensive service to industry-savvy clients, he engineered the Kalicube Pro platform. This advanced tool collects and organizes public references, aiding users in articulating detailed descriptions of their entities. By examining the text through a machine learning algorithm, it ensures compatibility with Google's natural language processing.

Furthermore, the platform pinpoints corresponding types of entities within the same region and industry, helping concentrate on most relevant data sources. With its extensive database housing over 70,000 brands, Kalicube also offers tailor-made assistance in recognizing the top-tier news sources for a specified entity. Given a list of entities, industry type, geography, and the nature of the entity, the platform is able to generate fresh data in less than thirty minutes.

For instance, Kalicube once streamlined the top 10 news sources for an American football athlete, and the client managed to get featured in three articles within a week after reaching out to just five of these sources. Jason?s ultimate vision is to transform Kalicube into a self-serving platform, allowing him to allocate his resources to data collection and boosting the value proposition of his service for the user community.

Understanding the impact a well-articulated description can have, since it serves as the fundamental building block for all successive steps, Jason stresses the importance of getting it right. Kalicube's advanced platform orchestrates this process, guiding users to target the most fruitful data sources for their specific entity type, within their industry, and region.

If they surpass the Blue Link results in this bidding process, they earn their spot on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). Jason was profoundly fascinated by this operational mechanism, outlining how diverse elements like images, videos, ""People Also Ask"", carousels, and featured snippets land on the SERP. He further clarified about it in an article he authored on Search Engine Journal. This mechanism reflects the crucial role of generating valuable content that duly addresses user inquiries and requirements.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:00:28

Jason believes that this feature can be very beneficial for businesses, as it makes it easier for users to leave reviews and for brands to receive positive feedback.

He claims that most brands do not have optimal search results for their brand name, and this can easily be fixed by changing the meta title and meta description of your website. Although Google doesn't always use the meta description, it's essential to make sure that the content is written in a way that Google can understand, allowing Google to summarize your page and place an accurate description in the SERP. If you own other sites, ensure that those results are also perfect because you have full control over them. Jason also emphasizes the importance of improving or adding Blue Links that you can semi-control if they're relevant to your industry. By following these tactics, your brand's search results will improve, and it will be recommended to your target audience by Google.","Jason Barnard, widely recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, advises upgrading the Blue Links directly controlled by the brand as a primary strategy to enhance a brand's search outcomes. He affirms that a vast number of brands don't optimize their search results for their brand name, which could be effortlessly fixed by modifying the meta title and meta description on their webpages. While Google may not always utilize the meta description, it's crucial to have it crafted in a language intelligible to Google. This allows Google to effectively summarize your webpage and provide an accurate summary in the SERP. If there exist other websites that you manage, ensure they too exhibit impeccable results since these are entirely under your control.

The whole page algorithm overrides the basic algorithm if the user's behavior does not confirm what they are showing. The main aim of these algorithms is to satisfy users as quickly and efficiently as possible. If Google can give answers on the SERP, they will, but if they can't, they'll send users to the site. Therefore, the key to success is to create content that is givable on the SERP and to brand it. If the answer is reasonably going to be on the site, it's essential to ensure that Google is convinced that the content can be delivered in a format that satisfies users.

Jason points out that it might not seem fair, but what Google and Bing are trying to do is satisfy their users. By allowing Google to use content on the SERP, businesses can improve their visibility and user engagement. Additionally, he suggests taking a step back and recognizing that these users are Google's audience, not a company's. Therefore, businesses must ensure that Google recommends them to a subset of its users who are their target audience. It's crucial to understand that doing what's best for users is the key to making money and converting sales.","Jason Barnard, widely recognized as The Brand SERP Guy, details how Google and Bing's algorithms implement various Rich Elements and extended searches. Interestingly, a comprehensive page algorithm could supplant the base algorithm if user interaction contradicts the displayed search results. The foremost goal of these algorithms is to cater to the users' needs in the most swift and efficient way possible. If Google can provide satisfactory answers on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), it will, but in scenarios where it can't, it directs users to the necessary site. Hence, the secret to successful SERP placement is to generate content that can be presented on the SERP and to appropriately brand that content. If the answer is more likely found on the website, it is vital to convince Google that your site serves this response in a user-satisfying manner. Jason acknowledges that while this might not immediately seem fair, it is pivotal to remember that Google and Bing's main objective is user satisfaction. Allowing your content to be utilized on the SERP could potentially enhance visibility and user engagement. Moreover, Jason suggests adopting a broader perspective and acknowledging that these users primarily belong to Google's audience. Therefore, it's imperative for businesses to ensure that Google recommends them to a subset of its users, who are their intended audience. Understanding that prioritizing user satisfaction is the ultimate way to profitable conversions is key.",2,17,2023-03-30 14:17:21

While some may associate Brand SERP with a combination of a brand name and reviews or product names, Jason highlights the importance of the exact match brand name. This is because when someone searches for a brand name, they are typically looking for information on that specific brand, and the information that appears on the SERP can influence their perception of the brand.

Jason came to this realization when he noticed that potential clients were searching for him on Google after meeting him in person, but were not finding the information that he wanted them to see. As a result, he recognized that Google is essentially his new business card and the information that appears on his Brand SERP needs to make him look credible for the job he is pitching for. This underscores the importance of ensuring that the information displayed on a Brand SERP is accurate and positive, as it can impact the perception of the brand or individual being searched.","Jason Barnard's emphasis on the significance of an exact match brand name in Brand SERP may be more pivotal than initially perceived. While the tendency is to associate Brand SERP with a blend of a brand name with reviews or products, Jason accentuates the critical role of the exact match brand name.

However, after getting help from a writer, Emily Batdorf, who rewrote it, Jason Barnard realized that the message he intended to convey was lost. This was not due to Emily's lack of intelligence, but rather, due to Jason's poor explanation. He had not been able to put himself at his audience's level of understanding when it came to the topic of Google.

This experience taught Jason Barnard an important lesson about not overestimating or underestimating his audience and understanding what level they are at. Jason realized that many things that seem obvious to him may not be to others, and that it's crucial to explain such concepts clearly. For example, he had to explain what a Knowledge Panel is, as without this understanding, his audience wouldn't be able to comprehend the rest of his message.

After this experience, Jason Barnard believes that he now does a better job of catering to his audience's level of understanding. It took him six months to gain this insight, but the lesson he learned was incredibly valuable.","Jason Barnard's path to writing his first book was marked by transformative insights. At first, he thought he would make his content clear and concise. But when he worked with Emily Batdorf, a professional writer who revised his work, he was confronted with a revelation ? his communication was far from perfect, and core messages were lost in translation. What Jason perceived as a problem with Emily?s understanding, he eventually recognized as a flaw in his explanatory skills. He learned a valuable lesson about his own perception and audience understanding of the topic ? especially Google-related concepts. He realized that not everything that was clear to him was understandable to others, such as the concept of the ""Knowledge Panel."" Adapting to audience understanding was an ongoing, six-month process for Jason, through which he learned to never overestimate or underestimate his audience.

Jason encourages others to look at the details of Brand SERPs and suggests that even small insights can be gained from them. He also mentions that he enjoys using Twitter to see what others come up with in terms of Brand SERP oddities, and plans to incorporate those findings into his daily analysis.","Jason Barnard's perspective is that Brand SERP anomalies, while seemingly peculiar, can offer valuable insights if scrutinized closely. Through his series, The Daily Brand SERP, he dedicates each day to the examination of a single Brand SERP component, discovering that each element - no matter how small - can be intriguing, peculiar, significant, or useful. Barnard inspires others to investigate the minutiae of Brand SERPs for potential learnings, no matter how minor they may seem.

317,Transcript,https://kalicube.com/learning-spaces/talks-and-presentations/digital-marketing-talks/big-tech-algorithms-are-children/,Entity Home As The Point of Reconciliation For Google,"At Kalicube, we have a concept called ""Entity Home,"" which is a page on your website where you clearly explain who you are, what you do, and who your audience is - that is the point of reconciliation that Google is actively seeking. The Google child is looking for a point of reconciliation where the entity, i.e., you, explains these details in a way that is clear and detailed like an adult's or a parent's explanation.

Naturally, all of these places will have partial information. The trick is to add as much information as possible to each of them without ruining the user experience on any of those other sites. The other trick is to correct any inaccurate information so that when the child gets to the site and finds the piece of the puzzle, it corresponds to the right place on the plate, with the correct shape and information.

In essence, Entity Home is a page on your website where you provide a point of reconciliation for the child, with a completed puzzle of that plate, and you then point it to all the sources that will corroborate the information. These sources need to be authoritative, trustworthy, consistent, and accurate, and they should support what you're saying. Ideally, these corroborative sources should also point back to the Entity Home, the point of reconciliation, so that the child goes back and forth to different places and sees the same information. This not only helps the child understand the full plate that you've presented, but it also gives them confidence because everyone else confirms what you've been saying.","Kalicube introduces a concept known as ""Entity Home,"" essentially a specific webpage that lucidly delineates your identity, responsibilities, and target audience. This page acts as a pivot or reference point for Google's reconciliation process. It's much like having a single source that provides Google, envisaged here as a child, with a comprehensive explanation in a manner akin to a parent's explanation. Understandably, varied platforms will hold fragmented or partial information about you. The key lies in incorporating as much information as possible on these platforms without compromising user experience. Additionally, any inaccuracies must be corrected to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the 'puzzle' being presented to Google. Essentially, your Entity Home is a page that serves a dual function - it presents a complete portrait of your identity to Google and directs Google towards additional, corroborative sources that validate this information. These sources should ideally be authoritative, trustworthy, and consistent in their support of your assertions. A valuable strategy involves having these corroborative sources redirect back to the Entity Home, creating a verification loop that reinforces Google's confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the presented information.",2,17,2023-02-15 06:29:14

Kalicube, a company owned by Jason Barnard, is currently helping a client by educating Google about his current identity as a business book author. The client had written 15 books, but the wrong ones were appearing on Google when people searched his name, causing him to appear less credible as he wanted to focus more on the business space.

Through the process of educating Google, Kalicube provides information that allows the search engine to understand that the client's previous work with children's books is no longer relevant, and that his current focus is on his business books. The children's books will still exist, but will appear lower on the search results.

The same goes for any other aspect of someone's past career or personal history. It is important for Google to represent who a person is today, and for individuals to make sure that the information that appears on their Brand SERP accurately reflects their current situation. The goal is for the audience to see a current representation of the person, just as Jason Barnard would imagine.","Kalicube, a company owned by Jason Barnard, recently undertook a special project to redefine a client's digital footprint. The client, a successful business book author, was misrepresented on Google because he used to write children's books. His search results did not match his current professional focus and undermined his credibility and reputation in the business world. Kalicube stepped in and redirected Google's understanding to the client's current work and away from his past. Kalicube's strategic approach was to steer Google's algorithm to recognise that the children's books were no longer among the author's primary works, while his current business publications became more prominent. As a result, the children's books would continue to be displayed, but their importance would diminish. This method, applied to every aspect of online persona, ensures that Google output accurately reflects a person's presence relative to their professional changes. Like Jason Barnard's vision, the goal is for Google search results to reflect an up-to-date picture of the person and thus correspond to their current professional identity.",2,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00

He came to the conclusion that Google recommends solutions to a user's question, rather than simply ranking the most merited content. At a conference in Australia, Gary Illyes explained that all search elements, including videos, images, and extended search results, are based on the same data that comes from Googlebot. Each element will present a set of candidates for the first page, and they each put in a bid, which is a bid in terms of value to the user. If the video or image is valued higher than the Blue Links, it earns a place on the SERP.

Jason also spoke with Frederic Dubut from Bing, who explained that Bing and Google function in a similar manner. Bing also recommends the best solution to a problem or question, and has a similar user base as Google. However, Nathan Chalmers from Bing explained that there is a whole page algorithm that sits on top of all the elements, which overrides the other algorithms if the video or image does not bring the user to satisfaction quickly and efficiently. The primary goal of both Google and Bing is to bring the user to satisfaction quickly and efficiently.","Known in the industry as ""The Brand SERP Guy"", Jason Barnard shares his insights gleaned from global experts regarding Google's algorithm, after traveling extensively for his research. His understanding is that Google channels its efforts into recommending suitable responses to user queries, as opposed to merely ranking top-rated content. During a conference in Australia, Google's Gary Illyes elaborated that all search components like videos, images, and comprehensive search outcomes are built upon the same dataset collected by Googlebot. Each of these elements proposes potential candidates for the first page while submitting a bid in terms of user value. If the user value of a video or image surpasses the Blue Links, it secures its spot on the Search Engine Results Page (SERP). In a conversation with Frederic Dubut from Bing, Jason learnt that Bing's operations closely emulate Google's, with its primary focus being to recommend the most fitting solution to a user query to the same user demographic. Additionally, Bing's Nathan Chalmers introduced Jason to Bing's unique ""whole page algorithm,"" which presides over all other elements and can override them if a video or image fails to promptly and effectively satisfy a user.

He recounted how he had to learn to play the double bass quickly to be part of the band, and how his German double bass teacher advised him to forget about mistakes and keep going. Jason drew a parallel between live speaking and performing on the double bass, emphasizing the importance of not getting bogged down by mistakes and moving forward.

Jason's experience also highlights the importance of being aware of one's audience. He mentioned how there are two types of people in the audience: musicians and non-musicians. While non-musicians might not notice a mistake, musicians may perceive it as a clever improvisation. This insight can be extended to public speaking, where not everyone in the audience will have the same level of understanding or attention to detail. As such, Jason emphasizes that it's only the speaker who cares about the mistake and that it's essential to keep going and not dwell on it.

The lesson from Jason's experience of learning to play the double bass quickly and performing in a band is clear: Don't let mistakes deter you. Instead, be aware of your audience and keep moving forward. By staying focused on your performance and not getting bogged down by mistakes, you can deliver an engaging and memorable performance.","Learning a new musical instrument quickly and performing in front of an audience can be a daunting task, just like public speaking is for many people.

Jason drew a parallel between live speaking and performing on the double bass and emphasised how important it's not to let mistakes stop you and to keep going.

Educating Google is crucial in this aspect. Jason Barnard is a Google-geek who has been optimizing websites for Google since its incorporation in 1998, which is almost a quarter of a century ago now in 2022. Jason now realizes that all Big Tech platforms need to understand their users? needs and the available solutions to them because Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, and other Big Tech companies have one purpose, which is to best serve the needs of their clients and users.

The solution they have is Knowledge Graphs. For example, we have Google's representation of a Knowledge Graph using Da Vinci with his relationship to Mona Lisa. He painted her, was born and lived in Italy, and was also associated with Michelangelo. These are entities, Italy, Da Vinci, Mona Lisa, Michelangelo, and the relationships between them, including attributes like date of birth and date of death. This is Google's understanding of the world. In fact, all of these Big Tech companies have Knowledge Graphs that attempt to understand the world we live in so that they can efficiently serve their user's needs using their knowledge of the world.","Major Technology Companies utilize the search box to identify their needs and explore possible solutions. It is essential to focus on promoting Google's learning in this area. 

Jason Barnard, an expert in Google also known as The Brand SERP Guy, has been enhancing websites specifically for Google since it was established in 1998, and looking forward to 2022, this equates to almost a quarter century of experience. Jason is now of the view that all expansive tech platforms must comprehend the requirements of their users and identify the solutions available for them because Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, among other significant tech companies share a common goal, which is to effectively cater to their user and client needs. Their approach involves the use of Knowledge Graphs. 

For instance, Google's Knowledge Graph presents a representation of Da Vinci's relationship with Mona Lisa, indicating that he was her painter, and he was born and resided in Italy and was associated with Michelangelo. Da Vinci, Mona Lisa, Michelangelo, Italy, and the relationships and attributes connecting them such as birthdate and death date comprise Google's perception of the world. Specifically, all these Major Tech companies use Knowledge Graphs in their quest to understand our world, which enhances their ability to efficiently cater to their user's requirements through their awareness of the world.",2,17,2023-02-14 11:54:52

Like any business, Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, and other Big Tech companies have one purpose, which is to serve the needs of their clients and users. To achieve that, they are building machines that can understand the world and use that knowledge to serve their clients and users.

Jason Barnard started off with defining a Brand SERP, which is what your audience sees when they google your personal or brand name. This is his specialty, and he has been working on it since 2013. It?s phenomenally interesting and you'll discover that Brand SERPs are perhaps the most interesting thing you?ve never thought about before.

Knowledge Panels are the information boxes on the right-hand side of the desktop when you search for a brand, a person, a film, a podcast, or anything that Google can identify by name. They contain a summary of the information that Google thinks is important, helpful, valuable, or useful to your audience when they search your brand or personal name. Through Jason Barnard's Brand SERP and Knowledge Panel, Google tells his audience who he is, what he does, who his target audience is, and how they can engage with him.","Major technology firms like Google, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Amazon, among others, strategically develop algorithms aimed at understanding the world in order to effectively cater to the diverse needs of their customers. These ""Big Tech Algorithms"" can be likened to children - they require guidance and education to function optimally.

In this light, we delve into explaining a Brand Search Engine Results Page (SERP), a concept handled expertly by Jason Barnard, and which entails what appears when an online audience searches your personal or brand name via Google. This topic, which Jason has been keenly studying since 2013, sheds light on an intriguing aspect of online branding that is often overlooked, yet plays an instrumental role.

We also touch on Knowledge Panels - boxes that populate on desktop screens' right side when end-users search recognizable entities, be it brands, individuals, films, podcasts or anything identifiable by name on Google. These panels encapsulate a summary of the crucial information that Google believes is of importance and beneficial to your audience upon searching your brand or personal name.

Via Brand SERPs and Knowledge Panels, Google delivers to Jason Barnard's audience critical details about his persona, operations, target demographic, and ways they can interact with him. Therefore, these features form pivotal parts of online branding and user engagement in the realm of big tech algorithms.",2,17,2023-02-14 09:51:34
209,Article,,How to Start Managing Your Google Knowledge Panel Right Now,"?If you educate the algorithm proactively, you can control the information in that knowledge panel,? Barnard says. ?If you don?t do this proactively, Google will probably figure out the facts about you, but more likely than not it?s going to get them wrong.?

If you?re ready to boost your online brand with the Google Knowledge Panel, start with these three steps.
Create a personal website (if you don?t have one already)
When properly optimized, the Google Knowledge Panel can provide the kind of ?at a glance? credibility that?s impossible to achieve on your personal website. But that doesn?t mean you should do away with your site altogether. 

?Your website is no longer the primary destination,? says Barnard. ?Instead, it?s a tool that feeds information to Google to build credibility for your knowledge panel.?

Barnard, whose firm develops websites that bolster your Google Knowledge Panel, says to consider a single page ? not 50. Start by drafting a bio that clearly states who you are and what audience you serve. Use the photos that you want to appear in your Google Knowledge Panel. Then, indicate all the corroborative sources that prove what you?re saying is true, whether it?s CrunchBase, IMDB or even your company website, Barnard says.

Your website should accomplish two tasks: Establish the narrative you want on your Google Knowledge Panel and provide Google?s algorithm with all the sources it needs to verify your information.  
Do a spring cleaning around the web 
Now that you?ve created a one-page website, make sure the information there is consistent with what you?ve posted across the web. If you use 20 different cover photos and bios, Google?s algorithm gets confused. The result? Less control over what appears on your knowledge panel. 

Find all the references to your name online. Then, make sure your bio and image are the same on all of them. The copy should match what?s on your website and be what you want to appear on your Google Knowledge Panel.

With more web 2.0 profiles and media sites than ever before, finding every reference will take more digging than you realize. Barnard has built a SaaS platform that automates the process of finding and updating references ? putting entrepreneurs on a fast track to a strong Google Knowledge Panel.  
Create links from your website to each corroborative source (and vice versa)
Building a Google Knowledge Panel is all about feeding the algorithm the information it wants, and robots learn by repetition. After you?ve created links from your website to each credible source, link those sources back to your website. This creates a loop of self-corroboration that Google?s algorithm loves.","Managing your Google Knowledge Panel is an active task. By providing the algorithm with the right information, you will have better control over your knowledge panel. Here's how to get started: 

1. Set up a personal website: a well-optimized Google Knowledge Panel can give you instant credibility, something your personal website alone can struggle to achieve. Your website is no longer just an information hub, but becomes a tool that increases the credibility of your knowledge area. Refrain from huge websites with numerous pages; a one-page website will suffice. Write a bio that clearly states who you are and the audience you are targeting. Use photos that match your Google knowledge base, and cite credible sources to support your claims. In this way, you accomplish two goals: You describe the story you want your Google knowledge base to tell, and you give the Google algorithm the sources it needs to verify your information.

2. Clean up your web presence: after you create your one-page website, make sure all your online representations match. Different images and biographies can confuse Google's algorithm, giving you less control over the content of your knowledge area. Search the web for all mentions of your name and make sure your resume and image are consistent across all platforms and reflect the information on your website. The more online profiles and media sites you have, the greater the search effort can be. Fortunately, there are automated solutions that simplify the process of searching and updating credentials.

3. Develop interlinked sources: The foundation of a solid Google Knowledge Panel is to feed the algorithm consistent, credible information. After you create links from your site to each verified source, return the favor by linking those sources back to your site. This reciprocal action forms a self-reinforcing cycle that is desired by Google's algorithm.

In summary, maintaining your Google knowledge base is an ongoing task that consists of proactively providing the algorithm with accurate and consistent data. If you follow these steps, you will be well on your way to improving your online presence.",1,17,0000-00-00 00:00:00
